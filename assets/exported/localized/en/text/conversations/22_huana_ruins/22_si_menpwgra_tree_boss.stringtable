      <DefaultText>This corrupted tree bows crookedly under its own weight. Every limb drips with thick, putrid sap. Its vines have entangled the tip of an adra pillar and seem to be infesting it with the same rot that permeates the surrounding jungle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You call out to the tree using terms it would understand - growth, time, water - appealing to its old and forgotten nature. 

You command it to expel the dark infection in its heart. 

The surrounding vines shudder and pulse in response.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The core of the tree offers you desperate images of health, long life, and food - all dark promises.

Temptation and want are the only motives the tree seems to understand anymore. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear a sound like a rock splitting in half. Dark sap oozes from the cracks between the bark, sizzling when it touches the ground. 

A creaking of wood follows as vibrant color slowly eases up the roots of the healthy tree.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mad awareness underneath the poisoned bark awakens to your interference. It calls out with a sound that no ear should perceive. Your focus breaks, and you hear the heavy footfalls of an approaching form. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You sense the life force of this tree reaching out to a distant figure - something old, wild, and mad. 

You have little doubt that interfering with the tree will alert this being to your presence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As soon as the contact is made, a tremor passes down the length of the wood, and an unearthly howling emanates from the core of the tree. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Down in its core, the tree is still green and alive. 

It won't be long before the whole organism becomes a ravening parasite, but it seems aware enough to slow that inevitable decline.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No sooner is the contact made than the vine withdraws, a mixture of hesitation and fear sending it retreating back to the tree with shuddering, snakelike motions.

      <DefaultText>&lt;ispeech&gt;NO. I gave you the others. This one is mine.&lt;/ispeech&gt;

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>The staff twists in your hands like a living limb, wrenching itself in the direction of the blighted tree. It seems eager to plunge into the rivulets of dark sap.

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>Its surface is pitted and slick with sap. Though the pillar still connects to the Wheel, the tree has adapted to feed its roots by draining raw essence. 

Giving the tree enough essence to sustain itself would put an end to the parasitic connection. </DefaultText>
