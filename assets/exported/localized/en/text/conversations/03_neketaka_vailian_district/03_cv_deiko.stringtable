      <DefaultText>"Aloth! This is the last place I expected to see you! Have your interests changed so much since our time at Bragganhyl?"

      <DefaultText>The dancer turns to greet you, a coy smile tugging at his lips.

He's short for an elf, but no less graceful for his lacking height. His long face and dark eyes lend him a solemn air, but any hint of gloom is chased away by the wash of color in his cheeks.</DefaultText>
