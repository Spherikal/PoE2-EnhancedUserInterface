      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] points at the ship in the distance. "Galleon, captain. A three-master. Or it was."

Naught remains of the ship's foremast save a splintered stump, and the bowsprit has been sheared off.

"See how they crippled her? That's the work of pirates. Pr√≠ncipi most likely, and probably the upstarts if they're raiding this close to Vailian patrol routes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a small boarding party and scour the galleon. Most of its cargo and all of its crew are missing, but you do find several barrels of fresh water and a few sacks of dried rice and coarse meal.

Your competent hands make quick work of the task. You return to the ship and order [Specified 0] to set sail.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] salutes. "Very well."

The crew scrambles to their posts, eager to be clear of the area.

Once the ship has disappeared behind you, the crew abandons nervous glances for relieved laughter.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 2] leans in close. "They'll have taken any gold, but they might have left supplies."

[Specified 1]'s brow is damp with sweat. "We shouldn't stick around. If the Vailians see us plundering one of their ships, they won't give us a chance to explain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're still aboard the galleon when [Specified 0] calls out a warning.

A ship with the lines of a Vailian privateer is speeding toward you. 

The crew aboard [Player Ship] scurry across the deck, readying the ship for combat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a shake of the head, [Specified 2] sighs. "Or we could sink the loot, I suppose."

[Specified 1] nods. "Aye, captain."

[Specified 0] shouts orders, and crew begin readying the guns belowdecks.</DefaultText>
