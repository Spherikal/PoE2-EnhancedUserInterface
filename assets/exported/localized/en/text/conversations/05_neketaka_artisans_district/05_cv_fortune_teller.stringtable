      <DefaultText>The puppet's eyes close and he steeples his fingers. You hear gears whirring and clicking inside the box.

His eyes reopen, this time with an amber glow. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I see a woman with... black hair. No, red hair. Very dark red. Or maybe it really is black. She'll want you to recover her... wedding ring. When she pays you, be careful - there's a scorpion hidden in her coin purse. I know not why."

His head clicks to the side, disturbed.</DefaultText>
