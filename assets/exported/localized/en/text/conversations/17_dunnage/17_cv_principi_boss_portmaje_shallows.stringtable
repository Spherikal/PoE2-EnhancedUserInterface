      <DefaultText>"Aye, there's boat holds I ain't telling you, Watcher. Ain't telling you about the lass I have back on Deadlight. Ain't telling you what we did or didn't do last time I seen her, neither. Certainly ain't telling you about the secret pirate handshake that'll get you in the door."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;i&gt;The scene billows away, ice cold and clawing, replaced with the crew on deck, solemn and staring, as Furrante grasps one of their own by the throat. No, not one of their own, no more. You don't steal from family and stay family. 

Tears and mucus mar the man's features as Furrante reads the man his last rites. Thief or no, they'll consign him to Ondra as tradition dictates...&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;i&gt;Prismatic light explodes behind your eyes as the images wash over you. The bow of a ship, bowsprit jutting rigidly forward, seeking, searching, mind freed and sliding across the waves, the minuscule thoughts of sea beasts shining below, the gulls above, all eating, fucking, shitting, the circle eternal.&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;i&gt;Cold, wet, then parched throat, heat, wind stirring fur, shouting, cannon fire somewhere distant, the adra colossus, dawn-radiant in the distance - look away! It burns! - the rum flows belowdecks, a party and you out here, searching still.&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

Furrante glares at Serafen. The orlan steps back, blinking away the rebuke, and peers at you, probing. His yellow-green eyes narrow, unfocused, as if trying to remember something.

Then the captain turns a warm smile back to you.</DefaultText>
