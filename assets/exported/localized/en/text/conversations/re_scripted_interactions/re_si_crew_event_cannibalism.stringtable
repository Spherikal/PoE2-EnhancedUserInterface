      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] opens your door so weakly it may as well have been a breeze. The hand shuffles into the cabin, bony arms hanging to the side like dried moss.

"Food’s getting low, captain." The sailor shivers, and skin flakes and floats in the scant lighting. "And, uh, we were thinking, on account of us needing food, of… taking measures beyond the… normal pale."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] nods numbly. "This isn't something I take lightly, captain. You want a name? Alright..." The sailor considers. "[Specified 1]. There. Said."

[Specified 0] breathes heavily, as though the simple name weighed the whole room down. The hand stares at you, eyes pleading you to say or do something. Anything.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An hour later, [Specified 0] reenters, a shiner borne below the eye and a plate in the hands. A slab of reddish meat rests upon it, smoke still lazily wafting upward.

"Your dinner, captain."</DefaultText>
