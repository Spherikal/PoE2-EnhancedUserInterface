      <DefaultText>As your hand touches the dim adra, you feel the same cool, pricking sensation that you did when you touched the pillar near Port Maje.

You concentrate on the pillar. The world around you swiftly falls away, leaving only the vast emptiness of the In-Between, the adra, and a multitude of golden threads undulating off into the distance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For a second time, you gather the threads in your mind and bind them together, forming a solid tether that ripples out toward its distant anchor.

Again, a crack sounds from the terminus. Your consciousness is violently pulled along the cord. You are prepared for the sensation this time, but are still disoriented when you come to a sudden stop.

You find yourself standing behind a familiar titanic statue as it trudges through invisible waters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You begin to gather the threads in your mind, but find that they do not resist you as they did at the first time.

The filaments float, unmoored, through the all-encompassing gloom. Though energy still pulses through them, it emerges at the far end of the threads in brief and distant golden clouds, like far-off sidereal fireflies.</DefaultText>
