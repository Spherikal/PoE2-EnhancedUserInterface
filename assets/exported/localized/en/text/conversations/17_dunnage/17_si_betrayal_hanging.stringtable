      <DefaultText>Once the most powerful pirate in the Deadfire, Furrante now stumbles forward - shoved by a guard with a blood-tipped spear. The captain's shoulders are slumped, a rough noose cinched around his neck, as he reluctantly walks a long plank overhanging the roof's edge. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mark my words, captain - I'm going to haunt you for the rest of your days," she taunts Furrante.

      <DefaultText>Furrante trembles when the plank wobbles beneath his boots, nearly tripping off the side mid-way. He stops before reaching the very end and tosses a last look at Aeldys over his shoulder.

      <DefaultText>"Suppose this is where we part ways, lovesome. I'll be dreaming of you in the great beyond. Don't shed too many tears for me."

She mimes you a last kiss. Then with a lazy grin curling her lips, she steps out from the plank.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Then he meets your gaze, words fumbling on his lips, but before he can get a proper plea out, the guard stomps hard on the plank, and Furrante is jarred over the edge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Furrante trembles when the plank wobbles beneath his boots, nearly tripping off the side mid-way. He stops before reaching the very end and tosses a last look at the Consuaglo members over his shoulder.
