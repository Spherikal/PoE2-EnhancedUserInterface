      <DefaultText>A woman lies dead on the tiles, her skin discolored with decay. 

Her rent flesh sloughs away to reveal bone. No maggots or bugs have reached her here, which only means that there's more of her left to assault your nostrils.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you handle her remains, clumps of muscle and flesh fall off, raising a fresh wave of rot.

Most of her belongings are slimy and rancid with putrescence, but her pack has escaped the worst of it. 

Inside, you see a few torn pages and a carved figurine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman's body lies at the end of a trail of smeared, crusted blood. The damage to her armor suggests a fight, though it looks like her attacker - or attackers - allowed her to crawl away to die.

Holding your breath, you kneel to search the body. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>They look like they were ripped from a book or journal. They're brown and warped with spilled drink and scrawled with a few brief entries.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The wooden figurine has the body of a woman and the head of a fish, with beady eyes and a gaping, snaggle-toothed maw.

It's pale and rough-textured, like it was carved recently.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It looks like an idol of Ngati, the Huana trickster goddess.

You know from your studies that idols like this are sometimes used to carry the blessings - or curses - of the gods they represent.

Sure enough, scratched under the idol's feet, you see the markings of a confusion hex.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But as your thumb slides across the bottom, you notice something carved there.

You probably wouldn't recognize it without your years of religious study, but it looks like a confusion hex.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But as you study the piece, you get a sudden image of a woman - a priestess - carving it by candlelight, muttering furious, frantic curses.

Sure enough, a confusion hex is carved on the bottoms of the feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are an explorer with the Vailian Trading Company, and you are searching the ruins with your comrades. At least they used to be your comrades. 

Now, you're not so sure.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Things have been going wrong ever since you got to this island. First with Gian, then Olara. 

Though it might have started earlier, on Tikawara. Maybe when Vektor fell sick.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hear a scream in the distance. You don't know where the others are. You don't know why there's blood on your hands. 

You don't know why it's so hard to think.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But you remember that you were supposed to be quiet to avoid the notice of whatever is down here.

Something moves in the darkness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sabre boasts a viciously serrated edge. Despite the state of its former master, the blade appears to be in good condition, and you retrieve it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Careful, Watcher. That thing's got a nasty hex on it. Confusion, feels like." Xoti's nose crinkles as she leans closer to examine the figurine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oi, cap. That barnacle bait be radiating confusion, or my blue ass ain't blue. Feel all fathom-headed just looking at it."

His ears twitch as he peers narrow-eyed at the figure.
