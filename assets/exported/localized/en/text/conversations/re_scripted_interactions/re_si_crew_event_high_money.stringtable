      <DefaultText>You're nursing a mug belowdecks with the crew, watching a game of lurch, when a small group of hands, deep in their drink and looking emboldened, approaches you.

"Captain." [Specified 0] bows with a doff of the cap. "We were all noticing that you've come into a fair bit of coin in your travels." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0]'s mouth hangs open for a moment before curling into a huge smile. She raises her mug. "To the best captain a sailor could ever ask for!" 

A chorus of hurrahs follow. Word spreads to the rest of the crew faster than flame to a powder keg, and, for a while at least, the crew greets you with warm grins and doffed hats.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Smiling brightly, [Specified 0] bows. "Yes, captain."

The sailors take the purse, and you hear them dividing the takes for the next half hour. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] scowls. "So you say, captain. But sometimes a body needs a little more than stale tack and watered-down grog." The others nod, muttering. "I'll leave you to it, then."

For days after, you can't help but notice the scowls that greet you as you move about the ship.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're at the bow when [Specified 0] and a few other hands wander up, hats in hand. 

"Greetings, captain. We were wondering if you'd given any more thought to the question of coin for the crew."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0]'s features drain of blood as the other mates shrink away from you. "Understood, captain." 

They scatter.

      <DefaultText>The hands look to one another, expressions darkening.

"Understood, captain." [Specified 0] scowls. "I'll pass your regards to the rest of the crew."

      <DefaultText>The cheer almost shakes the boat. Soon ale and rum is flowing, washing down double rations of spiced and salted meats. The sea shanties persist late into the night, and questions of pay are forgotten... for the moment.</DefaultText>
