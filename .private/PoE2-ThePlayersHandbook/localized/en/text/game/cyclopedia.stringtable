      <DefaultText>God of golems, machines, industry, strength, hope, and aspiration. Favored most commonly upon the laboring class. "The Golem" is thought to have once been able to take a human-resembling form as most of the other gods are, but then been somehow killed, only to forge himself back into existence inside the shell of an immense golem. Various accounts of his death exist, and none is considered definitive.</DefaultText>

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;bydon is associated with industry and progress, but has never been viewed as a
source of inspiration or invention, which are the domain of &lt;link="gamedata://640ff637-4e5c-4396-bb7a-504a9875df85"&gt;Hylea&lt;/link&gt;. Instead, he is
seen as the unfailing hand that enacts the designs of others, like his patron, &lt;link="gamedata://a9c6b117-b0b6-4f78-b045-abf49d3fd6ad"&gt;Magran&lt;/link&gt;, and he is identified with the great masses of craftsmen and skilled tradesmen whose labor raises cities and shapes metals and gemstones from the depths of the earth.&lt;/line-indent&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Origins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
According to ancient tradition, Abydon was once a god like most of the others, capable of taking human form. Then he was slain - by one of the other gods, according to some stories - though the reason has been forgotten with time. For some period afterward, Abydon was thought to have been destroyed. His immortal &lt;link="gamedata://b46ac104-6114-466f-80c1-badf3ed1e0f4"&gt;essence&lt;/link&gt; lingered however, eventually taking shape and fashioning a new, artificial body for itself, piece by piece. Finally, Abydon returned to “life,” somewhat diminished in power. With Magran’s help, he claimed a new dominion, becoming patron of industry, machines, and skilled labor. Centuries later, Abydon remains loyal to Magran, forging weapons for her campaigns and often appearing at her side in depictions of the war goddess.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Fable of Abydon's Demise&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
Although disputed by many, some of his followers tell a tale of how Abydon sacrificed himself to save Eora from destruction. In their reckoning, Ondra—the godess of seas and oceans—had become frightened by kith's ingenuity. Although the gods had agreed among themselves not to meddle in kith's affairs, Ondra nontheless concocted a plan to wipe out all civilization in the hope to stop kith's from ever being able to rival the gods. Ondra thus began pulling Eora's smallest moon, &lt;b&gt;Ionni Brathr&lt;/b&gt;, on a collision course with Eora, intending to end kith's advancements and in the process securing the pantheons dominion over all.&lt;line-height=140%&gt;
&lt;/line-height&gt;&lt;line-indent=3em&gt;Upon learning of Ondra's plan, Abydon, the (then) god of preservation forged himself a hammer worthy of a god and capable of sundering the earth itself. Channeling all his strength he hurled his hammer against the moon, shattering it. The moon split into many pieces, some of which fell back to the land harmlessly, while others drifted beyond, into the void. But the biggest fragment of the moon remained and unless someone intervened would soon collide with the planet. Abydon, for want of a better of option, threw himself in it's way, protecting the land from destruction but fatally wounding himself in the process. He was already dead when his massive body slammed into the remote mountains of &lt;b&gt;the White March&lt;/b&gt;, where it lay until only the bones the diety remained.&lt;line-height=140%&gt;
&lt;/line-height&gt;When Ondra heard of Abydons demise, the ever-sorrowful god decided to hide her treachery and to honor his sacrifice erected the &lt;b&gt;Abbey of the Fallen Moon&lt;/b&gt; around his body, thus hiding his caracas from plain sight so that neither Gods nor kith would learn of her meddling.&lt;/line-indent&gt;

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clergy and Followers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
To many in the working classes, Abydon is a comforting god, demanding nothing of his followers beyond a hard day’s work and forthright service to their employers, customers, and lords. He is also an aspirational deity, representing hope for a better future by honest labor instead of plots or machinations. He encourages his followers to remake themselves by learning new skills and trades, just as he “remade” himself in his new artificial form. All of his clergy are expected to master a practical skill such as smithing or carpentry, and to teach that skill to those who are eager to learn. As such, Abydon has become quite popular, despite his unusual form.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interactions with other Gods&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
In the intrigues of the gods, Abydon takes little part, though he serves Magran loyally and always takes her side against her enemies. &lt;link="gamedata://b0ea40f0-7c90-46c0-9a8f-0fd2941ba662"&gt;Skaen&lt;/link&gt; hates Abydon, who represents exactly the sort of passive surrender to authority that “the Quiet Slave” despises.&lt;/xg&gt;

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;erath is the god of cycles, of doors, and of life and death itself. As the god of
cycles, Berath is the custodian of &lt;link="gamedata://6b1a6b57-477a-425f-b419-fb1bf57e0b2f"&gt;the Wheel&lt;/link&gt; and is thought to be the diety that
ushers souls from &lt;link="gamedata://30dd45b1-97e5-4d29-8a20-734a96df1feb"&gt;the Beyond&lt;/link&gt;, into their new bodies— their new lives. People show reverence to Berath by placing or carving it's symbol in doorways, windows, and other “portals” from one place to another—figurative or literal. Berath is commonly referred to using neutral pronouns like “it”, although specific manifestations (e.g., “the Pallid Knight” or “the Usher”) are often gendered.&lt;/line-indent&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Origins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
As one of the oldest gods known to &lt;link="gamedata://e7eb7ebf-757a-4bd9-afdf-5a9c51615f63"&gt;kith&lt;/link&gt;, Berath can be found carved into the archways of ancient &lt;link="gamedata://5754862e-f591-4c98-9b4d-d7453c603a90"&gt;Engwithian&lt;/link&gt; ruins. These carvings most commonly depict Berath in the form of two semi-skeletal figures (one male and one female) in opposite position of each other. Called “Bewnen i Ankew” and “Ankew i Bewnen” (literally translated to “Life in Death” and “Death in Life” in the &lt;link="gamedata://35aeb4b7-cb06-4bf8-8239-9e6c472919f7"&gt;Glamfellen&lt;/link&gt; tongue) the skeletal figures are thought to symbolize Berath’s twinned nature and has been a way to establish Beraths dominion over both live and death in religious dogma throughout the ages.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clergy and Followers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
Berath has a relatively small priesthood, in part because it does not speak often to its members. However, Berath has many, many petitioners and occasional followers. While the common folk usually fear the priesthood of Berath, many respect them for their level-headedness and unflinching resolve in the face of endless death and suffering.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Berath and Rymrgand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
Berath and &lt;link="gamedata://d1d95d7e-0617-4c0c-a8c5-233d3af1c2e2"&gt;Rymrgand&lt;/link&gt; share a complicated relationship within the divine pantheon. Though both figures lord over death, Berath is viewed as having dominion over death’s cycle, while Rymrgand is the master of entropy. Some theologians believe Rymrgand would prefer the cycle dismantled, the souls who take part in it disintegrated. This oppositional standpoint is reflected in Rymrgand’s worshipers, who view their resurrections as punishments instead of blessings.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manifestations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
“&lt;link="gamedata://bce2fe98-4a0c-49be-929d-ee868c970a0a"&gt;The Pallid Knight&lt;/link&gt;” is a manifestation of Berath that has appeared in legends for at least three centuries. In these legends, someone escapes or otherwise cheats death and encounters (or is pursued by) a gaunt female knight in black armor with black hair and eyes and “milkpale” skin. The knight demands an impossible-to-pay toll for traveling on her lord’s road for too long. The implication is always that the person has overstayed their welcome in the mortal world and it is time for them to move on. Sometimes the person surrenders to the knight, sometimes they attack the knight and wind up killing themselves in the process, and sometimes they flee from the knight and stumble into the Usher.

“&lt;link="gamedata://2716b76f-8a0b-4f72-9579-3e856fcd94cf"&gt;The Usher&lt;/link&gt;” is a very old manifestation of Berath. In stories, he often appears much more obviously supernatural than the Pallid Knight, with skeletal features or simply as a walking skeleton. The Usher is typically human, but occasionally appears as a dwarf. Unlike the Pallid Knight, the Usher never speaks, but simply creates a circumstance for the unwitting and unwilling to march to their doom (sometimes directly into their own grave).

Sometimes these manifestations appear alone, but often they are paired, with the Pallid Knight “blocking” the way and the Usher opening the door to the afterlife. The Pallid Knight is a more martial and confrontational figure (in part because she also speaks), while the Usher is more subdued, inviting, and occasionally deceptive.&lt;/xg&gt;

It has been described as a hazy landscape, empty but for the glow of other souls, adra, and Watchers.

      <DefaultText>"The In-Between" refers to the shadow world that souls (briefly) wander after death on their way to the Beyond. It has been described as a hazy landscape, empty but for the glow of other souls, adra, and Watchers. This is the space that Watchers peer into when they observe and speak to lost souls and soul fragments. Even the gods cannot reach it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Caed Nua was a Dyrwoodan castle built over the ruins of the Endless Paths of Od Nua. Considered cursed, few ventured into its halls and even fewer made any effort to hold the castle or the lands around it.

You became the de facto lord of the castle after defeating its previous master, the Watcher called Maerwald. As the Watcher of Caed Nua, you ruled the stronghold until it was destroyed by Eothas. The god of light occupied the adra body of Maros Nua beneath the castle and pulled himself out of the ground, destroying it in the process.</DefaultText>

Gaun is an answerer of wrongs and imbalances. This has contributed no small part to Dyrwood's enthusiasm for vigilante justice. Popular regard for Gaun is polarizing: he is appreciated, feared, and characterized by a grim sense of finality. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Grand Vailia was a sprawling and culturally rich empire with Vailian colonies settling far north and south of Eir Glanfath. However, problems with the empire's Aedyran expansion efforts, along with a steep economic decline, led the Vailian colonies to secede in 2641 AI, establishing themselves the Vailian Republics, a confederacy of allied city-states.

For the next century, Grand Vailia collapsed into Old Vailia as more and more nobles and their retainers fled the empire, many of them immigrating to the Deadfire. Initially trying to survive as merchant ships, these immigrants eventually descend into piracy as their trade networks decayed and were taken over by nascent Vailian and Rauataian colonies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rikuhu is the twin eel god that represents the cyclic connection between overworld and underworld, life and death. Often depicted with the two constituent eels: Kohopa, representing the overworld and life, and Tangaloa, who represents underworld and death, devouring one another by the tail.

Due to their similarities, Rikuhu is often described as the Huana's manifestation of Berath—the god of cycles, of doors, and of life and death itself.</DefaultText>

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;any &lt;link="gamedata://57a7dedc-c427-468d-af58-3a523900c7a8"&gt;Huana&lt;/link&gt; worship &lt;link="gamedata://f647c4e8-baa3-4f25-87b3-01fed733ee33"&gt;Berath&lt;/link&gt; as “Rikuhu”, the twin eel god that represents the
cyclic connection between overworld and underworld, life and death. The
symbol of Rikuhu depicts two eels in a circular configuration, each devouring the other by the tail. The topmost eel is &lt;link="gamedata://f174e6ff-4855-4235-a6b0-41fec8995e0a"&gt;Kohopa&lt;/link&gt;, representing life and the known world. The lowermost is &lt;link="gamedata://b03e5828-9b54-4ae0-ba7b-b2b76a82445a"&gt;Tangaloa&lt;/link&gt;, representing death and the world beyond mortal understanding.&lt;/line-indent&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Folklore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
In Huana folklore, Kohopa and Tangaloa were born before time existed, and each had an insatiable appetite. They began to devour all living things, and with each thing devoured, they became larger. When there were no living things left to eat, and the two eels were so enormous as to encompass all existence, they began to devour one another. Thus, all beings are perpetually passing through the digestive tracts of the two eels. When one reaches the end, it passes through the mouth of the next eel - the gateway to or from the underworld - and the next stage of existence begins. The notion of time is merely one's perception of the digestive process.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clergy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
Priests of Rikuhu commemorate their role in the cycle by delivering sermons from within the skeletal jaws of giant eels. This signifies their responsibility to pass on the wisdom of the dead to the realm of the living, as they take it upon themselves to prepare the community in mind and soul for their next voyage through the turn of &lt;link="gamedata://aa84a208-bee6-4536-9e88-6fec651e7e17"&gt;the Wheel&lt;/link&gt;.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Death and Reincarnation in the Archipelago&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
The Huana do not generally fear death and its communion with the eternal cycle (no more than any other &lt;link="gamedata://e7eb7ebf-757a-4bd9-afdf-5a9c51615f63"&gt;kith&lt;/link&gt;), but some disagree on the structure on which this cycle is built. Among the more fervent and enthused of religious worshipers, a whispered belief holds that time exists within Rikuhu alone, and outside of the eels stretches the void and eternal dream from which all things once sprang. They imagine an existence without duration or knowing, where &lt;link="gamedata://98266fd8-5ede-48fd-9a02-8e11710ce4b3"&gt;Amira&lt;/link&gt; and the rest of the great beasts still roam. In this unimaginable vista, the souls of all beings comingle with their ancestors and descendants simultaneously. If Kohopa and Tangaloa were satiated (or even killed), then their bodies would separate and kith could rejoin the paradise and dream that was stripped from them so long ago.&lt;/xg&gt;

      <DefaultText>Ukaizo is a mythical island rumored to be somewhere in the Deadfire Archipelago. Some legends regard Ukaizo as the wellspring of Huana culture. Others tell of riches beyond measure. All agree that Ukaizo vanished after cataclysmic storms and volcanic eruptions blotted out the horizon, but it remains to be seen if these tales possess an echo of merit or simply romanticize an ancient fantasy. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A series of fallen Pargrunen territories that were settled by dwarves in the earliest colonial years of the Eastern Reach. The most prominent settlement, Durgan's Battery, was well-known for its high quality bronze art objects and unparalleled steel weapons, shields, and armor. Over several decades, the White March's various settlements were either overrun by myriad raiders or collapsed due to growing fears of instability. The stronghold of Durgan's Battery was apparently abandoned and sealed almost two centuries ago, marking the unofficial end of the White March.

The arms of the White March can still be seen on fine pieces of bronze and steelware circulating in the Eastern Reach. The symbolism of the mountains is obvious, but the linked circles at the top were common to many Pargrunen settlements, representing the common link of kinship between them. The yellow field, not often found on metalwork, indicated the bronzeware that the White March was initially famous for.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>“The Pallid Knight” is one of the youngest manifestations of Berath—the god of life, death, and reincarnation—and one quite familiar to kith.

Stories describe her as a gaunt knight in black armor with black eyes, black hair, and milk-pale skin. She demands an impossible toll from travelers who have tarried too long on her lord's road. The person either surrenders, or fights the knight and kill themselves in the process, or flee from him to stumble upon “the Usher”.</DefaultText>

Stories, songs, and poems have been written about the Usher for centuries. Sometimes he's folk, sometimes dwarf, and sometimes merely a walking skeleton. He never speaks, but he guides the way to death. And the next life. He also creates the circumstances for the wayward to stumble into their own graves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The cultures of Eora are historically peopled by a mixture of diverse racial backgrounds. This means that characters cannot be measured against any predetermined notions about dwarves, elves, or other familiar ﬁ gures. A dwarf from the Vailian Republic, for example, might have more in common with a Vailian elf than he or she would with a dwarf of the Deadﬁ re archipelago. While creating a character, and encountering others along the way, it is more important than ever to consider the innate complexities of personal history and heritage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A diverse medley of races populate Eora. Their separating characteristics are more apparent on a cultural level, with racial boundaries presenting neither roadblocks nor advantages in any given dealing between civilized men and women. An elf from one of the Glanfathan tribes, for example, would share more kinship with a dwarf of a neighboring tribe than with an elf from the Aedyran Empire. The one certainty is that Eora’s races can breed only with their like kind, and unions between divergent races have never proven successful from that standpoint.</DefaultText>

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;he aumaua are a large race that originated and typically live and work in warm
oceanic climates. Though they are not the most widely traveled racial group in the
world (that distinction belongs either to Calbandran humans or Aptapo dwarves), they have been exploring and settling continuously for the longest period of time, over 20,000 years.&lt;/line-indent&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ethnicities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
Aumaua have two widely divergent ethnicities that are geographically separated by thousands of miles, likely due to a huge migration that took place over 15,000 years ago. Aumaua are not found in large numbers in any heterogeneous cultures but when they do integrate into non-aumaua cultures, they tend to assimilate fully. They are occasionally found in Dyrwood, the Vailian Republics, Readceras, and, rarely, in Aedyr. They are most often found in or near port cities.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Physical traits&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;
Aumaua are physically distinct from other races due to their towering size, “inverted triangle” physique, odd skin and hair coloration and textures, and head shape. Aumaua natural lifespans are typically between seventy and one hundred and fifteen years.

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;outhern Island Aumaua, originated in the Deadfire Archipelago a thousand miles
south of the Vailian Republics. While physiologically similar to their coastal cousins,
the coloration of Island Aumaua is starkly different - brown and yellow. Though still uncommon in the Dyrwood and surrounding environments, Island Aumaua are more commonly encountered there than Coastal Aumaua, who are quite rare. When encountered outside of Deadfire, they are often laborers, fishermen, or sailors.&lt;/line-indent&gt;

      <DefaultText>Island aumaua originated in the Deadfire Archipelago and have largely remained there over the millennia. While physiologically similar to their coastal cousins, the coloration of island aumaua is starkly different - warm tones, contrasting the coastal's cool blues and green. While not all island aumaua are connected to the native Huana culture of the Deadfire, it is rare to find them in the Eastern Reach, much less the Old Empires.</DefaultText>

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;welling primarily in the Northern Hemisphere, so-called “coastal” aumaua live in a
conquered mainland region, mostly along the coast. Coastal aumaua cultures are
more centralized and urban than their southern counterparts, though they are still involved in seafaring.&lt;/line-indent&gt;

While it isn’t accurate to think of island aumaua as peaceful and coastal aumaua as warlike, that is exactly how many people in large parts of Eora view them. The reason for this is connected to the ancient campaign of war in which aumaua pushed Thyrtan, Natlan, and orlan communities out of a number of territories. Because this successive series of wars allowed the aumaua to resettle the northern lands, it is vaguely recollected in many people’s minds.

Coastal aumaua are more common in Aedyr than in Dyrwood or surrounding areas, but when they are encountered, they are often mercenaries, bodyguards, or soldiers.

      <DefaultText>Viewed by many in the Old Empires and Eastern Reach as a warlike race, the coastal aumaua are dominantly from the northern nation of Rauatai. Though they originated in the Deadfire Archipelago thousands of years ago, time and distance have divorced them from their distant Huana kin. Coastal aumaua are less intimately connected to the sea than island aumaua and are distinguished by their cool skin tones.</DefaultText>
