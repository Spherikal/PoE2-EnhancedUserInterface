      <DefaultText>"But the choice you make today shall define the fate of every living thing in Eora." He turns to you. Curiosity shines in his eyes, but there's something else there.

Pity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He returns your kiss, holding you tightly. His face feels warm against yours, and gooseflesh prickles the back of his neck.
