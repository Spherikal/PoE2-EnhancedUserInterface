      <DefaultText>"Drink, sir?" 

The man at the bar goes about his business in merry defiance of the fact that he appears to be semi-decomposed. 

Behind him, a dwarf hangs upside down over a barrel. Blood streams down into the bucket from a wound in his wrist. From time the time the dwarf twitches feebly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't worry. The captain what founded this settlement, she left good people in charge.

      <DefaultText>You notice a glint of metal, and looking over you see a man in a gleaming helmet peering down over the balcony at you. He stares at you for several moments, wild-eyed, before scrambling away from the railing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't let the name frighten you. Rivan's founded a bright little community here in Splintered Reef.

      <DefaultText>"One of the very first settlers, from what I've been told. 

"Truth is, I haven't seen much of Menzzago these days. He must be busy, now that the town has grown so large."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Here, newcomer. First drink's on the house." 

He pours from a nearby pitcher - filling a goblet with an unmistakable red liquid, thick and dark. The coppery odor hits your nostrils with force. 

The barkeeper slides the goblet across the bar towards you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Oh... Well, you'll need to have a word with Zulka once she's here. She keeps strict tabs on everyone in town. For our protection, see.

      <DefaultText>"Turned up with an appetite, did you? Well, if Zulka don't turn up with the fish soon, I'll be hard-pressed not to consider it myself."

He chuckles to himself, enjoying the joke.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The barkeep pauses, looking over his shoulder. When he turns back to you it's with an expression of utmost confusion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You tip back the goblet, taking a long drink of its grisly contents. Almost at once you are struck with a sick, churning sensation in your guts, but you manage to keep your expression blank and your lunch down.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't got much on the menu, truth be told, but an ale ought to hold you over until Zulka and her people turn up with supplies.

      <DefaultText>"What? How dare you! My ale's the best in the Deadfire!" 

The barkeeper snatches back the goblet, fixing a scowl on you that's all the more horrific for his grisly aspect.</DefaultText>
