The chattering of your crew darkens, adopting an ominous tone. Gathered at the starboard railing, they peer out at the sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It hauls the skiff in a wide circle around the ship, knocking against the hull and nearly yanking [Specified 3]'s arm from the socket. 

Still, you feel the creature's strength beginning to wane.

Several hours later, [Specified 1] deems it safe to leap aboard the beast. With a few swift swings of a hatchet, the sailor severs the beast's spinal cord. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yet the magnificent creature continues alongside your ship for many hours. A low, mournful music rises above the light percussion of the waves, and a gentle peace envelops your crew. 

When night falls, the beast is beside you still, a comforting light in the darkness. 

By morning, it is gone, but the sense of calm it brought remains. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Giants of the deep," [Specified 0] says. "Huana say they live at the bottom of the sea, where they can be near the heart of the world, and surface only once in a great while. It is considered rare luck to see one."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A long, pale creature breaks the surface of the water. Its skin is translucent and freckled with phosphorescence, and you can make out the ghostly outlines of luminous organs beneath it. The creature rolls slowly, staring back at you with a glowing blue eye. The nerve behind it is as thick as a halyard.

[Specified 0] smiles. "This one is young still."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Harpoon in hand, [Specified 2] leaps from the skiff, using the downward momentum to drive the weapon into the beast's flesh. The creature thrashes, its tail slapping [Specified 2] from its back and into the water.

The line from the harpoon to the skiff goes taut as the whale drags the skiff along.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ship crests a high wave before plunging into the next trough, shuddering down its length. Clinging to the rail, [Specified 0] shouts orders from the aftcastle as water rushes across the deck.

      <DefaultText>You open yourself to the creature's thoughts, and feel the potent pulse of its soul tingling at the edge of your own consciousness.

It feels particularly intricate, its mind almost as complex as a kith's.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your crew ropes up the beast and lashes it to the side of the ship. They strip rich, fatty meat from its corpse and prepare it for storage.

      <DefaultText>The front of the skiff breaks the surface, throwing [Specified 3] sharply against the gunwale, as [Specified 1] holds the end of the severed line.

      <DefaultText>Off of the portside rail you see a dark shadow rising from the depths. The water splits around a hump of thick, mottled skin.

      <DefaultText>Your crew tie off lines across the beast and loop them over the ship's rails. They swarm the carcass, stripping meat and draining oils.
