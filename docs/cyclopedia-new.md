## The Wheel

Called the "Builders" by the tribes of Eir Glanfath, the Engwithans are believed to have created strange, elaborate structures over decades using shaped pillars of living adra to support the stone. One such creation is thought to be the Wheel, also known as the "Wheel of Life and Death" or "Berath's Wheel".

When a living thing dies, its soul enters the In-Between, and when the In-Between grows full, it releases souls into the Beyond, where they wait to be redistributed into new bodies, new lives. 

The Wheel facilitates the process by which souls are moved from the In-Between to the Beyond. Without the Wheel, it is speculated, the souls of all who die &lt;i&gt;remain&lt;/i&gt; in the In-Between. And without souls to fill it, the Beyond gradually empties, trapping all the remaining souls in existence in the In-Between - thus ending life as we know it in Eora.

It is not known, however, when the Wheel was constructed and what, if anything, came before it.





 &lt;i&gt;truly&lg;/i&lt; knows of what, if anything, came before the Wheel. of what concequence the Wheel plays in contemporary Eora but  
      
      Also known as the "Wheel of Life and Death" or "Berath's Wheel", it is believed the Wheel was created by the Engwithans and is the process by which souls are moved from the In-Between to the Beyond.

Created by the Engwithans, the Wheel is the process by which souls are moved from the In-Between to the Beyond.

When a living thing dies, its soul enters the In-Between, and when the In-Between grows full, it releases souls into the Beyond, where they wait to be redistributed by the Wheel into new bodies, new lives.

The Pallid Knight spreads wide her hands. "Think of the Beyond as a reservoir, the In-Between as storm clouds, and souls as rain."

"Without the Wheel to mediate the transfer and redistribution of souls, the souls of all who die &lt;i&gt;remain&lt;/i&gt; in the In-Between. And without souls to fill it, the Beyond gradually empties, trapping all the remaining souls in existence in the In-Between."

"When a living thing dies, its soul enters the In-Between, and when the In-Between grows full, it releases souls into the Beyond, where they wait to be redistributed to new bodies, new lives.

"One day, our bodies will perish and our souls will return to the Wheel."

"Both gods and mortals alike rely on the Wheel. We depend on it for the souls that give us power. Mortals depend on it for the lives of future generations. Breaking it will force all of us to face the truth."

"Without the Wheel, souls won't reincarnate and kith will eventually die off."

"I deduced that it was possible to escape the cycle, escape Berath's grasp. To remove one's soul from the Wheel." - Ydiwn

"With the Wheel destroyed, kith will tear themselves apart. It is the gods' duty to prevent that happening lest they doom us all.

"And as kith must be ruled, so too must the gods. I say that if Eothas is so eager to throw down the mantle of power and step aside, I shall take my rightful place as queen of the gods again."

"The Wheel is another chance for a soul that has not found freedom. This end they speak of, it would mean they suffered for nothing."

"Spells are fueled by ambient essence in the ether. A miserly trickle of energy that leaks from the Wheel." He traces arcane shapes in the air around him.

Berath's Wheel
Also known as the "Wheel of Life and Death" or simply "the Wheel," Berath's Wheel is a metaphorical concept used to describe the collective churning of souls as they leave their bodies upon death, exit the world through pillars of adra, and then are reborn in new bodies.

---
"Behold, thou faithful, the visage of thy transformation.
Fear not the journey when the portal opens.
Become one with the Wheel with glad heart and cheerful countenance.
For the doorway shall open for all in their time.
Neither the rich nor influential, neither kings nor rulers, neither the strong nor powerful can escape its embrace.
Berath will usher thee through the doorway and thou willst return to life, thy mortal life begun anew.
There goest the cycle. There goest life. There thou goest also.
 
Thou shalt approach the door, the inevitable shall approach thee.
Do not turn back on the portal, do not turn back on new life.
Walk the path and welcome change or face the knight
For he walks the road with thee and will guide all to their destination.

Thou mortal, the skull thou wilt become.
Thou closed off, the key thou shalt turn.
Thou sealed, the threshold thou shalt cross."

#### Odd Nuas take on the Wheel:

> Od Nua's voice gains a distant quality. "We sought the place where the veins of the world meet. Where a soul might be drawn from the adra. If we could find the means to keep the soul intact. To preserve its memory. We are so close. It is nearly done."

> Let them know what it was that the Engwithan people stole from their king. What treason has wrought.

## The In-Between

"And so you wake to a sleepless world, the In-Between of life and death."

"And so, robbed of your castle, torn from your body, your soul wakes to a sleepless world, the In-Between of life and death.

"In life, you spoke to souls wandering the In-Between. Lost souls, like you are now."

The bones of Eora's dead sink into the soil, and their untethered souls leach into the In-Between. 

The world ends as others have begun - a lifeless rock in a cloud of essence.

>Adra is a mineral which grows from the center of Eora. It breaches the ground in appendages not unlike standing stones. 

The function of adra is to draw wayward souls from death's waystation (the In-Between) and into the Beyond. It is a naturally-occurring vessel of soul essence.

Luminous adra contains so much soul essence that it glows with ethereal, green light. 

In addition to being a useful tool for animancers, luminous adra can be mined, milled, and carefully refined into a liquid form. Applied to the skin, this substance increases vitality and delivers an overall feeling of youthfulness.

Luminous adra is native to the Deadfire Archipelago. The discovery of its value made the possession of island territory an incalculably rich investment.

"Think of the Beyond as a reservoir, the In-Between as storm clouds, and souls as rain."

"When a living thing dies, its soul enters the In-Between, and when the In-Between grows full, it releases souls into the Beyond, where they wait to be redistributed to new bodies, new lives.

"Without the Wheel to mediate the transfer and redistribution of souls, the souls of all who die &lt;i&gt;remain&lt;/i&gt; in the In-Between. And without souls to fill it, the Beyond gradually empties, trapping all the remaining souls in existence in the In-Between."

"When the Beyond is empty and the last creature on Eora dies, that is the end of everything. It is Rymrgand's future, the one he wants for us."

"The Wheel is the process by which souls are moved from the In-Between to the Beyond, from the rain cloud to the reservoir, and from the reservoir into the living world."

"The In-Between" refers to the shadow world that souls (briefly) wander after death on their way to the Beyond. It has been described as a hazy landscape, empty but for the glow of other souls, adra, and Watchers. This is the space that Watchers peer into when they observe and speak to lost souls and soul fragments. Even the gods cannot reach it.

Maerwald:

"Many lifetimes we have. Souls enter womb and exit corpse. Carry with them all experiences, all knowledge, all identities.

"Yet we do not remember. Hidden from us. What end? What end? Only the gods know.

"Certain things can stir memories from lives long buried. Awaken the old memories, the old personalities."

The keep was his way of defending his family's claim, and that claim became his obsession. He had to know what lay beneath."
