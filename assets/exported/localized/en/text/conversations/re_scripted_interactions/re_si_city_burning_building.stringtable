      <DefaultText>In the higher reaches of Neketaka, slanting shanties and buildings of foreign design fall away to be replaced by colorful, open homes with wide wooden doors boasting intricate reliefs. Rather than pester you for a bit of coin or a bite of food, the children here try to sell you tickets to a play or extol the benefits of the public baths.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You burst through the back door onto an almost abandoned street. A group of ragged kith holding torches are the only people present. You note one of them holds a bulging sack stained with blood.

One of the kith, a broad-shouldered human in a tight-fitting mask, scowls. "Got ourselves a hero, seems. Sadly for you, the boss were clear on us leaving no witnesses."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your party follows, breaking through their formation and sprinting down the streets, a downpour of knives and torches clattering past. 

As you flee, you turn to see that [SkillCheck 0] cradles a bleeding arm. Your compatriot stumbles against a wall, forehead cracking against the bricks.

Thankfully, the gang, perhaps sensing that the guard could arrive at any time, doesn't give chase, instead retreating into the alleys from whence they came.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You blaze a serpentine path down the cobbled streets, dodging a storm of thrown knives and torches. 

The gang, perhaps sensing that the guard could arrive at any time, doesn't give chase, instead retreating into the alleys from whence they came.

With the thugs gone, your adrenaline cools and, like a magic trick, unveils a severe burn that you must have received during the escape.

      <DefaultText>A heavily-built aumaua uncrosses his thick arms and raises a hand. "Ekera, it's that Watcher, isn't it?"

The masked man blinks from him to you. "[Player Name]?" He jerks his head towards the building. "These fools owed Dereo too much for too long. We're just reclaiming what's his."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sky breaks open, dropping a deluge of water that sends the intricately-attired Hauna fleeing for overhangs and archways.
