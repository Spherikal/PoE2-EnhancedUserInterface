      <DefaultText>He sighs. "You'd think they both would have grown out of it by now."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I'm a little worried about Aloth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I conne yer look, Edér. Something's champing at ye." Iselmyr watches through Aloth's eyes, looking at Edér in concern.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I been telling folks I'm all right. But the truth is, thinking about facing Eothas keeps me up at night."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aye, I expect so. 'Tis a stouter feat than braving that eld bonebag, Thaos." A shudder ripples through Aloth's body.

Edér frowns.</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Didn't think much rattled you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>She shrugs. "An' so ye shouldn't. Someone's got to keep the lad on his feet."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's just an old habit. He can stand on his own now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I like him to think so."

Iselmyr falls quiet for a moment, knotting Aloth's fingers together in a very Aloth-like fashion. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <DefaultText>"You're a gentler soul than you let on. Wish more people could see it."</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Most folk judge only by their gapin' and gawpin'.

"Not so with ye."

She inclines Aloth's head toward Edér.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I had you wrong, too. Up till recently. But I'm glad to know you now."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fye, Edér, there's plenty ye dinnae conne of me." Iselmyr's grin warms Aloth's face.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If matters were... otherwise, I could see a lass like me with a right-fine lad like yerself." Iselmyr's smile turns bittersweet.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Always thought you were special, too. Shame you're stuck where you are."

A quiet moment lingers between them.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Gets a lass to wonderin'... aw, fye and coxfithers, pay me no heed."

Iselmyr turns away, eyes cast down.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hey. You can ask me."

He touches the back of one of Aloth's hands in reassurance.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've wondered whit it might feel to have yer arms 'twining me. Yer lips on mine." Aloth's ears redden.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Uh... huh. Didn't think you meant- 

"Wouldn't Aloth mind?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ye dinnae conne him as I do. Poor lad has a kind, trusting heart. He wants that I should be happy."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If that's- if that's how he feels... I want you to be happy, too."

He touches the outside of Aloth's hand again.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>Aloth's fingers spread and slide into place between Edér's. With Aloth's other hand, Iselmyr reaches up and runs his fingers down Edér's cheek, stepping closer as she does so.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>Suddenly, Aloth's eyes fly open. 

Iselmyr is not behind them.

He jumps back, shoving Edér away.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; are you doing?" Shock and indignation color his face.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aloth?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Who else would I be, you idiot?!"

Just then, Iselmyr's cackle erupts from his throat.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ooh, yer face, Edér! Only thing finer'n seeing it is feeling this lad's ire!" She laughs even harder.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fye, whit's that I feel? Might it be a kindlin' where-" 

Iselmyr's laughs dissolve into a coughing fit from which Aloth finally emerges, furious and red-faced.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I think we can all agree to forget that ever happened." He folds his arms and doesn't meet your eye or Edér's.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>77</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This all makes a lot more sense now, looking back."

Edér's face is slack and sober. He blinks rarely, if at all.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>83</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Oh, now I get it. That's pretty good. Heh."

The chuckle is so uneasy it almost sounds like a question.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What is it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>85</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't want to discuss this right now."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sure. Some other time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>87</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I think the strain of the journey is getting to him. He's not his usual self."

Edér's expression is grave.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>88</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The old Aloth, he used to really like it when we made fun of him."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>89</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But the new Aloth doesn't just sit and take it. 

"It's like he's losing his sense of humor."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>90</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is that everything?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, not all of it. There's the Leaden Key."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We went all that way through the Dyrwood to stop them. And now Aloth just picks up where Thaos left off?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>93</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The Leaden Key, I don't need to tell you what they did. Just about everything I ever cared about back home, they ruined it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>94</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What do you suppose Aloth's been up to these last few years? And why do you suppose he's back here, with us?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>95</ID>
      <DefaultText>"What are you saying?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>96</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's enough, Edér."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>99</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I know what you mean."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>100</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I dunno. Something doesn't sit right, is all."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>101</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You telling me you don't have suspicions?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>102</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't like thinking this way. I'm just not at ease since we, uh, happened to come across him."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>103</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not saying we gotta do anything crazy, but maybe we need to be more careful around him."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>104</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aloth has already proven himself to us."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>105</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I don't like it any more than you, but we need Aloth."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>106</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Aloth isn't Thaos. His Leaden Key is ethical, just as he is."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This is your problem. I don't care what you do."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>108</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right. I was there to see it. Just needed reminding, is all."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>109</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That doesn't give me a whole lot of confidence."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>110</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Heh. Aloth's about as far from Thaos as it gets. That does give me some hope."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>111</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fair enough. I'll have to think on it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>112</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah, I guess that's about it."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>113</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He did, once. But seeing as how he replaced Thaos, it makes you wonder about his reasons."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>114</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Not sure we wouldn't be better off just hiring somebody."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>115</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'd like to believe that. But it seems more likely the Leaden Key would change Aloth than the other way around."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>116</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He'd just stand there real quiet with his mouth sort of twitching and his eyes real big like he couldn't believe how good we were getting him."

Edér pauses with a nostalgic smile and a far-off look.

After a lengthy wait, the smile wanes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>117</ID>
      <DefaultText>He clears his throat. "Well. Appreciate you taking the time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>118</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I need the two of you to get along and work together."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>119</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ever think it might be that Aloth has grown?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>120</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If Aloth can't take a joke, that isn't your fault."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>121</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That's exactly what Iselmyr said, too! I can't imagine both of you being wrong."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>122</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right, I think that straightens some things out."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>123</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well sure, but... you don't wanna dig in, see if you can solve the problem?"

Edér watches your face.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>124</ID>
      <DefaultText>"All right, all right. I'll, uh, I'll see what I can do."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>125</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Grown? Aloth? How? He still does that thing with his hands. He still, you know..." Edér scratches at his beard, the strain of thought scrunching his face to a degree that looks painful.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>126</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Although I guess he set about taking apart the Leaden Key. Can't see Old Aloth doing something like that."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>127</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And he does say what's on his mind more."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>128</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Like now he tells us when he has to relieve himself, instead of disappearing from the campsite and getting us all worried."

Edér sighs.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>129</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I see your point.

"Gonna miss Old Aloth, though. He was a lot of fun."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>130</ID>
      <DefaultText>"See, that's not what he says. But I like your way better."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>159</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Let's discuss this another time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>161</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Very well. Was there something else?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>163</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Edér and Iselmyr - you've seen how they're always carrying on!"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>165</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've come to expect better from her, but Edér seems to bring out her worst."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>166</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And that bothers you?"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>167</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You must be tired of them teasing you."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>168</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sounds like you're jealous of their relationship."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>170</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I hardly care what those two rubes think." He frowns and falls into a defensive silence. 

Yet his twitching mouth and fidgeting fingers show the cracks in his facade. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>171</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's just... there's something about it that brings me back to our time in the Dyrwood."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>172</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I've changed, even if Edér hasn't."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>173</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of them?! You must be joking." He scowls and falls into a defensive silence. 

Yet his twitching mouth and fidgeting fingers show the cracks in his facade. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And you don't like being reminded of that."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>178</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps for you. You cured your Awakening and ended up with a keep.

"For a while." He clears his throat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You give him too much credit.

"As a matter of fact, you give everyone too much credit." He gives you a tired - but fond - smile.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>188</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Very well. I'll do as you suggest. In any case, thank you."</DefaultText>
