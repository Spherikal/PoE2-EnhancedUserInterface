      <DefaultText>"Good. Welcome to the Beyond. I am Berath. One half, anyway."

She points a finger in the direction of the dwarf who led you here. Though the movement is slight, her gauntlet squeaks like a rusty hinge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Your brush with the divine has drained you of your powers, fractured your memories. Look upon these cards. They represent the courses of your life. You alone know best how they flowed. Arrange them to fit what you remember."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Before you return to Eora as my herald, you must remember who you were, the last whisper of life in death."

For a moment, the sockets of her eyes darken, leaving the pits of a death's head gazing out at you.

      <DefaultText>"Go forth now, Watcher, as my herald. Know that I do not give you this title lightly. When the time comes, you will have the power to reveal the souls that cling to you, to open the gateway from the In-Between to the waking world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Thank you for joining us, Watcher of Caed Nua."

The gaunt woman seated at the table is clad in time-worn black armor that seems too massive for her to move in.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A pale, slender neck rises from the gorget, topped by a hollow face. The milky skin stretched across it is delicate and translucent, like parchment that has been scraped clean too many times.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She is preoccupied with the arrangement of cards on the table between you. With each movement, her armor squeaks and groans as though bearing an incredible weight.

She places a final card, gives a nod of satisfaction, and raises her eyes to meet yours.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>She places a card in the middle of the arrangement, a bell tower with no bell.

Her fingertips slowly drag away from the card, faintly creaking as they retreat across the table.</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>She slaps a card down, a broken bell in a tower. The crack of the card on the table ripples through your soul like a shockwave, leaving you momentarily disoriented.

Her fingertips slowly drag away from the card, faintly creaking as they retreat across the table.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The being that occupied Od Nua's statue beneath your castle was the 'dead god', Eothas. Of this, we are certain. What we do not know is what his intentions are."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You and he are still connected. He has chosen a body made of living adra, perfused with the power of thousands of souls - including yours. It should be little difficulty for an experienced Watcher to find him."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. But neither is your body truly alive. Your lungs draw breath, your heart pumps blood, but your flesh is as soulless as a Hollowborn. That is, until I return you."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Taking a physical form in Eora is fraught with peril. Most mortal minds and bodies are incapable of containing divine power. It can lead to... problems, as Eothas learned not long ago."</DefaultText>

      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>Her armored hand gingerly places a card sideways on the table. It features a man with a burst of light instead of a head.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You have a choice Watcher. Your soul has wandered into the Beyond. Your options are to serve me in pursuit of Eothas or to accept death and be returned to the Wheel."

With the last word, her features darken, the sockets of her eyes going black, her cheeks becoming so translucent that her teeth glow through the skin.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>She delicately places a card upright on the table. The art depicts souls flowing out of a pillar of adra.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>She casually tosses a card on the table. It lands crookedly in front of you. 
The illustration features a great wooden wheel. Some souls cling to the spokes. Others are grabbing hold. Still others are letting go of the wheel and floating in every direction.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, I'd like to find him as much as you would. He destroyed my castle and killed who knows how many people around it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Unfortunate. This will prove much more difficult without someone of your unique talents and circumstances."

She raises her gauntleted hand and gestures to the dwarf hovering at the periphery.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dwarf nods, the supernaturally wide smile returning to his face. He gestures for you to follow him.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course, if that doesn't convince you, I can always return you to the Wheel and find someone else to pursue him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a quick gesture of her hand, you feel a sharp pain in what would be your chest. The pain continues, intruding deeper into your soul. Looking down, you see a small lump of darkness roiling within you.

The darkness lingers there, but the pain abates and fades entirely within the span of a few seconds.</DefaultText>

      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Still, you remained true to me. Admirable. I suspect those wronged by the vows you broke will be less forgiving."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>84</ID>

      <DefaultText>"A chime. Do not fear, herald. It will not harm you unless you choose to cross me. &lt;i&gt;Again.&lt;/i&gt;"

The pits of her eyes darken briefly, flashing a death's head your way. The translucent mask quickly returns and her gauntleted hand gestures to the dwarf hovering nearby.</DefaultText>
