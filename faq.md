FAQ:

Q: Will this mod disable achievments?
A: No, neither this nor any other mod for PoE2 will disable achiements.

Q: Can I used this mod with "Magran's Fire" enabled?
A: Yes, for the most part. You won't have access to the new cyclopedia entries for various damage types and will in all likelyhood encounter "**Missing Strings**" messages when hovering over different damage types. If that's tolerable to you then all other mod features will work just as normal.
