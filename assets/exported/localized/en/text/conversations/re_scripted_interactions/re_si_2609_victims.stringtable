      <DefaultText>From the top of the cliff, you can look back over the western expanse of the island. The Deadfire shimmers blue towards the horizon, the islands of &lt;xg&gt;Kua o Rikuhu&lt;/xg&gt; just visible to the south. 

You can even make out [Player Ship] at anchor in the distance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's a three-strand twisted rope, much like those purveyed by any number of merchants across Eora. It seems surprisingly clean and unworn - easily strong enough to bear the weight of the heaviest kith.

The craftsmanship is likely Reacher, perhaps Dyrwoodan or Vailian.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The foreign kith jostle you with shoulder and elbow, prod you with blade and spear. Their armor - too heavy for the Deadfire - shines in the firelight, as if they were virtuous. 

You spit. 

No. There's no virtue in these godless raiders. They killed the young druid. They broke the elders' staffs and stole the doctor's herbs. Now they burn Amira's tree.</DefaultText>

What more can these foreigners take from you, you wonder, as they cut off lengths of rope.</DefaultText>
