      <DefaultText>"Ahoy, captain. Truth be told, Furrante half-expects us to get our asses blown out of the water at Fort Deadlight. Fortunately for you, I have this bad habit of beating the odds."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"She's sharp as shit, that one - tongue, mind, and ears alike. Sailed out of Dyrwood or Aedyr, one. Knows her knots and how to crew a ship that won't turn sour. Her words ring out among the Príncipi, more than you'd think for new blood."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Funny thing about it being a fort means it ain't a boat. Means it don't have to worry about the weight of cannons or storing honking big balls. Guns they got crowning that castle'll put a hole in your poop deck before you've sighted land."

      <DefaultText>You snatch the letter out of Serafen's hand. He looks shocked and angry for a moment, but then purses his lips and takes a breath. He turns his back to you.

The end of the letter reads: 

&lt;i&gt;I wish you a long and prosperous life. You carry with you all I could have imparted. While my legacy may otherwise be reduced to shame, know that you remain the exception. 

Yours, R&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>
