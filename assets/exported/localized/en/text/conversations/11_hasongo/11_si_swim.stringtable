      <DefaultText>The stairs descend to a flooded hallway. The water is clear, and the passage seems to continue for quite a ways.</DefaultText>

      <ID>6</ID>
      <DefaultText>As the passage begins to grow dim and the water cloudy, you reach an intersection where the walls are spiderwebbed with cracks. 

The hall continues to the left and to the right. The way on the left is dark. There's a faint glow to your right, but still, dark shapes obstruct the passage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your finely-honed sense of direction tells you that the hall to the right leads west, while the route to the left seems to bend southeast, back toward the docks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hallway curves around until you reach a door. It's swollen with water and stuck in place.

You give it a cursory tug, but it will take more effort to pull it open.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>You plant your feet on either side of the doorway and pull at the handle. 

After several sharp yanks, it flies open, revealing stairs to the surface. You swim up.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>You wedge the prybar into the doorjamb and, bracing your feet against the ceiling, push all your weight into it. 

The door pops open, revealing stairs to the surface. You swim up.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The route is much easier this time. Now familiar with the various obstructions, you navigate them easily enough.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>You pull yourself past the corner and into a labyrinth of carnage. Debris from half-collapsed walls and shattered barricades clogs the tunnel. Corpses, weighed down by armor and bloated with decay, bob and hover in the open spaces. 

You kick off the rubble to propel yourself forward. Even so, the way forward is more taxing than you'd initially thought.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>24</ID>
      <DefaultText>You navigate the obstacles with deft strokes and powerful kicks, reaching another intersection with a wood-paneled wall and a ruined green banner.

Seeing the promise of air and light on your right, you push toward it.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>You turn around and swim back, but your lungs are already burning by the time you reach the intersection.

You continue on and surface in the kitchen, gulping gratefully at the fresh air.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>You step into the water. It's cool around your ankles.

The stairs descend to the darkened, flooded passage. You are confident you remember the way back to the kitchen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You retrace your route, feeling your way along stone walls and following gentle currents.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>The wooden steps are warped and waterlogged, groaning underfoot. Scum floats atop the surface of the water, which feels oily against your legs. </DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>After just a few feet, you reach a wood-paneled wall with a green banner that billows gently in the current.

The hallway continues to your left - the section on the right has collapsed. The way is dark, and it appears to be constricted with debris.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>You press on, and by the time you have a chance to regret that decision, you're too far ahead to turn back. 

Your vision begins to darken. You pull and kick your way ahead, ignoring your burning limbs and focusing everything on the rapidly fading light. 

Just when you think you can hold your breath no longer, you see light on the right and break the surface, your abused body trembling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You press on. [SkillCheck 0] appears to be struggling, but by the time you notice, it's too late to turn back.

The exit is still a gray blur when you see the panic in [SkillCheck 0]'s eyes. You grab one of [SkillCheck 0]'s trembling arms and pull your companion toward the light. You reach a wood-paneled wall with a ruined green banner when you see the exit on your right. You push toward it.

Once out of the water, [SkillCheck 0] doubles over and vomits a mouthful of seawater, trembling with exhaustion.</DefaultText>

      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>You turn around and swim back, but your lungs are already burning by the time you reach the intersection.

You continue on and surface in the dining hall, gulping deep breaths.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You plant your feet on either side of the doorway and pull at the handle. 

The door doesn't budge, but the effort thoroughly exhausts you.

Having spent most of your strength, you're forced to spend the remainder frantically swimming back to the kitchen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] braces against the doorway and pulls at the handle.

The party is forced to swim back to the kitchen.</DefaultText>
