      <DefaultText>&lt;b&gt;Kahn&lt;/b&gt; has asked me to help her find &lt;b&gt;Oswald&lt;/b&gt;, an old elf who owes her 5,000 coppers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kahn mentioned that Oswald favored &lt;b&gt;Aenalys&lt;/b&gt;, one of the courtesans on the &lt;b&gt;second level&lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;Wild Mare&lt;/b&gt;.

Kahn told me that Aenalys refused to speak to her about Oswald or his whereabouts. She suggested I might have better luck with Aenalys instead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I found Oswald's journal in Aenalys' armoire. &lt;b&gt;Kahn&lt;/b&gt; will want to read it. I can find her on the &lt;b&gt;ground floor&lt;/b&gt; of the &lt;b&gt;Wild Mare&lt;/b&gt;.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Kahn heard tell of a massive temple dedicated to Woedica on a large island near the &lt;b&gt;Karatapu Channel&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;southwest of Neketaka&lt;/b&gt;.

Kahn suspects that Oswald was kidnapped and taken there by whomever has been stalking him.

She asked me to travel to the temple and get her money from Oswald, one way or another.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I found the temple Kahn told me about. With any luck, &lt;b&gt;Oswald's&lt;/b&gt; inside and still alive - or at least his money is still on his corpse.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;b&gt;Oswald&lt;/b&gt; was held captive by a cult of overzealous Woedicans and put on trial for oathbreaking. I convinced the people who kidnapped him to let him go.

I need to talk to him about the money he owes &lt;b&gt;Kahn.&lt;/b&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;b&gt;Oswald&lt;/b&gt; was held captive by a cult of overzealous Woedicans and put on trial for oathbreaking. He didn't survive their judgment.

The money he owes &lt;b&gt;Kahn&lt;/b&gt; might still be on his body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I discovered an elven man named &lt;b&gt;Oswald&lt;/b&gt; being put on trial by what appear to be agents of Woedica. I suspect he won't survive this situation without my help.

He told the agents that he could make them rich. I could save him and demand a reward... or I could just take the money off his body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The elf on trial was killed by his captors. Before he died, he mentioned that he could make his captors rich if they set him free.

I should search his body and see just how much money he had.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I searched Oswald's body, but didn't find the money he mentioned.

I suspect &lt;b&gt;Kahn&lt;/b&gt; at the &lt;b&gt;Wild Mare&lt;/b&gt; won't be pleased to hear this.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I found &lt;b&gt;Oswald&lt;/b&gt; held by a cult of Woedicans. I could intervene to help him, or just take &lt;b&gt;Kahn's money&lt;/b&gt; off of his body after the cult is done with him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Oswald was held captive by a cult of overzealous Woedicans and put on trial for oathbreaking. I didn't interfere with the cult and Oswald died. As it turned out, he didn't have Kahn's money anyway.

I need to return to &lt;b&gt;Kahn&lt;/b&gt; in the &lt;b&gt;Wild Mare&lt;/b&gt; and let her know. I suspect she won't be pleased.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From what I read in &lt;b&gt;Oswald's&lt;/b&gt; journal, it appears someone's been following him for some time. Strangely, the final entry in the journal is just a drawing of Woedica's broken crown symbol. &lt;b&gt;Kahn&lt;/b&gt; might know more.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I found the soul of a person who appeared to have been brought here by mysterious figures and put on trial. The soul insisted they were innocent. Perhaps the kidnappers were wrong about their victim, or maybe they just didn't care.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Based on a note I found on a corpse, it seems someone named &lt;b&gt;Inquisitor LÃ¶dwyn&lt;/b&gt; is the leader of whatever group is currently occupying this pyramid.</DefaultText>
