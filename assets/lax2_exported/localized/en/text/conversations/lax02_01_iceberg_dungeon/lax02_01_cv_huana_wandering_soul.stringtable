      <DefaultText>A lone shard of soul essence bobs just above the surface of the water.

As you reach out to it, a chorus of whispers rise in your mind. Though you can't make out what they say, a pall of fear and suspicion settles over you like a dark storm cloud.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You unfurl a map of your empire down the length of your grand feasting table. The outlander gasps as you show him its boundaries, which stretch to the edges of the world. He exclaims as you enumerate the many kith subject to your sovereignty.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Acrid smoke chokes the air. Fires rage across the city. You trip on a lump of shattered statue and crash to the ground. A sharp pain races up your arm. You are broken, too.
