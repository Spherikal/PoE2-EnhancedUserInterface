      <DefaultText>At the bar, you find a tall man with salt gray hair and strikingly bright blue eyes. His face sports a handful of long scars that continue down his neck and disappear beneath the collar of his shirt.

He looks up from wiping down the counter when you approach and gives you a broad, disarming smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Got to you, did she? The woman can spot a soft-hearted mark from fifty paces. Like a sixth sense or somethin'. Remarkable." He nods to you conspiratorially, as if he didn't just imply you were a sucker easily parted from your money.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You're right, though. Inherited on old dhow from my da when he passed. Right piece of shit it was, too. Realized I was bound to make more coin turning her into a tavern than letting her rot in her berth."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Unless there's something else you need, I think we're done here." He turns away and begins fiddling with something beneath the bar. As he does, you spy red-handled pistols stuffed into the band of his breeches.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Look at you, big spender!

      <DefaultText>"That's a shrewd observation. Maybe you're not so easy a mark after all." He rubs at the stubble along his jaw, lost in thought. Then he shrugs and flashes you that too-bright grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Haven't see you around before. Welcome to The King's Coffin." His smile is wide enough to show his bright, white teeth, but his light eyes remain cold and flinty.</DefaultText>
