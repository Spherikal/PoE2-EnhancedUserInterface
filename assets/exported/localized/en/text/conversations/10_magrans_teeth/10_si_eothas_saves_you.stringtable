      <DefaultText>Eothas' great hand floats away from the luminous adra pillar. As it pulls back, for a brief moment you see a golden tether flash into existence between the pillar and the great titan's back.

When the adra fingers gently cradle you, there is first a sensation of warmth, but it is followed by a harsh splitting of consciousness.

Your awareness vacillates erratically between the physical world and the spiritual dimension of Eothas' body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your soul glides amid the many trapped with Eothas. As your brilliant form passes by them, they call and reach out for help.

Below Eothas' body, the volcano erupts. Molten rock rushes over the great adra body, but does not slow its movement.

Rathun rush to higher ground, but cannot outpace the lava, which overwhelms and consumes them as it rises.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your attention returns to the heart of Eothas' body. Deep within the whirling masses of souls, you again sense your own presence, the fragment that was taken from you.

This time, you reach out to it as it reaches out to you. You meet somewhere in the great mass of adra, the rest of the souls fading at the edge of your awareness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your senses yank back to your body, still in Eothas' hand. There is light. Sunlight. He has emerged from Ashen Maw, the rim of the volcano and the great keep of the Rathun collapsing behind him. The adra is barely visible through the thick lava covering his body. And still, he moves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You feel cool air. Sea water. The back of your mind pulls your attention back to your body.

Eothas stands amid the now-calm waves, kraken futilely clinging to his limbs as he gingerly sets down your ship with one hand. He carefully opens his other, setting your body on the deck.

As your head comes to rest, your vision rocks forward, pulled back into the adra, back to your soul.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The soul rushes toward you, flying into you with ferocious speed. You are thrust back through the adra, out of the palm of Eothas' hand, back into your body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You can feel the sensation of your skin, the warmth of the adra, but you are not fully in control.

The other soul struggles to reach the surface of the body's consciousness, but you pull it down. Entangled, you float in a dark, boundless expanse. The more you fight each other, the closer you become, until somehow, impossibly, every piece of you is touching every piece of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Through the distant window of your eyes, you see Eothas push slowly against your ship. Though his touch is light, it is still the touch of a god. The ship lurches, rapidly tearing across the water, southward.

His hand pulls away from your ship's wake, his body straightening, towering overhead. The volcanic rock, now cooled and gently steaming, sloughs from his body as he moves. The adra beneath is still immaculate, unmarred.

He watches you depart and you hear a voice in your mind as you sink deeper into the blackness of sleep.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The words repeat in your mind until they become an incessant, meaningless mantra, involuntary meditation in the emptiness of your unconscious.

When the words finally dissolve and become part of the darkness, you see a pinpoint of light.

You no longer sense the other soul, no longer sense the person you were before Eothas touched you. You swim toward the light.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you come closer, the light becomes two blurry spots of radiance.

You settle in behind your eyes and feel your lips already moving, mumbling. Around your body, you sense familiar scents and sounds, voices raised in shock and alarm.

You take control of your mouth, opening it wide and drawing a great breath...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ocean is gone, water sucked away, leaving only the bare sea bed glistening in an ominous silence.

You summon the strength to turn your head. Through the cracks in the great god's fingers, you see a wall of water, taller than Neketaka, taller than Eothas, as tall as the moon. It comes with the rumbling of a terrible stampede.</DefaultText>

The great keep, recently abandoned by the Rathun, is quickly consumed by the lava.</DefaultText>
