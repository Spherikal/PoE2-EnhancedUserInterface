      <DefaultText>"There's an old story about Eothas. They don't teach it at church."

Edér's eyes trace the depression left by the statue's footfall, over half-submerged bodies and fragments of tiles that protrude through the mud like shards of bone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"And Eothas tells her, he says I can't do that. I can't upset the balance of night and day. It'll hurt the world."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There's still part of me, wants to believe he's trying to help."

Edér's eyes wander back to the footprint. He takes a long breath, then tears his gaze away.</DefaultText>
