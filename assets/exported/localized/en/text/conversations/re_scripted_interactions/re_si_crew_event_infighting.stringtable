      <DefaultText>"I know the rest of the crew doesnâ€™t want you aboard!" Spittle flies from [Specified 1]'s mouth as it looses invectives at Handsome Eliam. "With your fungus face and your drippy black bits. You probably get that shit in the stew!"

The godlike stands as still as the dead, his hidden eyes masking his expression. His fingers twitch, however.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You push your way through the crowd, the air heavy with the scent of sweat and seawater. 

"Come to see the action, captain?" [Specified 3] asks. "Do you want to put money on it? Mine's on the ugly one. I'll let you guess who that is!" The sailor laughs uproariously at the joke.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] fails to duck a blow to the head and reels into the bulwark. [Specified 0] jabs at [Specified 1]'s knee, sending the latter to the deck with a cry of pain. The crowd cheers.

"Yield?" [Specified 0] asks, offering the fallen a hand up.

      <DefaultText>The circle disperses at your words, and [Specified 2] grabs the two fighters and hauls them to the masts.

      <DefaultText>[Specified 2] splits the air with a shrill whistle, dulling the roar as the crew crane their necks to hear. 

"That's enough, everyone!" [Specified 2] levies a baton at the fighters. "You two, grab the tar. [Specified 1] on foremast, [Specified 0] on aft. And not a word between the two of you. The rest of you, back to your stations before the captain asks me to fetch the whip!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] ducks a wild blow, then lashes out at [Specified 0]'s legs, sweeping them. The latter sailor crashes heavily to the deck to the sound of raucous jeering.

"Had enough?" [Specified 1] asks, offering the fallen a hand up.

      <DefaultText>You block the noise out. Tensions rise after weeks at sea. You suspect it will sort itself out.

Later, you see [Specified 0] sporting a broken nose and blood-crusted lip, while [Specified 1]'s right eye has swollen shut. Each glares at the other, and the whole of the crew looks on edge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fighters' fists lower as the nearest crew take a step away from you.

"No need for that, captain." [Specified 1] shows you open palms. "Everything's fine."

      <DefaultText>Eliam begins to mutter, fingers shifting through sharp gestures. 

"Hylea's feathered tits," [Specified 1] mutters before swinging the sponge at Eliam's head. It strikes his head hard, and the oily sponge snaps off of the end, bouncing off of the bulwark and overboard.

With a single gentle movement, Eliam reaches out and brushes [Specified 1]'s arm with his fingers. A dark shadow pours from him and into the other sailor, whose eyes roll back. [Specified 1] shudders violently before collapsing to the deck.</DefaultText>

"It's over, everyone. You two," [Specified 2] gestures to two hands, "get [Specified 1] to the bunks. Everyone else, get back to work!"

The sailors return to their duties, a pall hanging over the deck like a thick fog.</DefaultText>
