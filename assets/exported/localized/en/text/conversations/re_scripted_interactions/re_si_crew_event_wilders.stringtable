      <DefaultText>The tension aboard your ship has thickened, cloying like humidity, the constant undercurrent of muttering not unlike the songs of crickets. On occasion, it rises to a volume difficult to ignore.

When you answer the knock at your cabin door, you find [Specified 1] wiping away sweat with a stained and tattered rag. "Captain. There's a problem that needs your attention."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] follows you out onto the deck, where the cool breeze off of the water immediately chills your exposed skin. A crowd of shouting sailors have gathered towards the bow, and you proceed towards them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Later, you notice Birta sporting some livid new bruises and cuts, but nothing compared to the thorough walloping [Specified 2] and [Specified 3] clearly suffered. 

[Specified 5] informs you that the ship required some repairs, given the damage Birta did it in her defense against the others.

Frustration continues to simmer aboard your vessel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Later you learn from [Specified 1] that the crew killed Big-Mouth, claiming they did so in self-defense. Several crew suffered injuries in the affray, but none worse off than [Specified 2], [Specified 3], and [Specified 4].

Despite that, the mood aboard the vessel noticeably improves, the previous muttering replaced with laughter and bawdy songs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're not sure where Birta found the massive knotted post she's swinging back and forth to keep the angry crew distant, but each arc of it threatens to take out a sail, the rails, or some other important part of your ship.

"Birta don't eat that much. Just enough for real woman." The ogre makes a sound that may be a grunt or a chuckle.

[Specified 2] scowls. "I'm more worried about what'll happen if things get worse. Ogres aren't known for their good judgment. What happens when she starts beating on the hull or the mast?"
