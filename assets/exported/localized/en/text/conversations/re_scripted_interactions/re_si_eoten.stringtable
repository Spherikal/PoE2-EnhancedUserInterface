      <DefaultText>You realize that what you initially took to be several large, lumpy stones are in fact eotens, two-headed monstrosities. As you watch, one of them absent-mindedly lifts a boulder and hurls it into the sea. The eotens guffaw, their laughter guttural.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you charge forward, weapons drawn, the eoten in the sand stumbles to its feet. It roars in rage, rousing its companions, who move to meet your attack.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The eoten in the sand grunts with surprise. It looks to either side, then cranes its neck to stare up into the sky. It waves its hand in front of its face with a confused grunt. 

The eoten with the broom laughs at its blinded companion, but then its eyes fall on you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you move towards the eoten, one of its heads snaps towards you, perhaps having caught your movement out of the corner of its eye.

With surprising speed, the beast lifts a massive clump of sand from off of its buried crotch and hurls it at you. Though the projectile disintegrates in the air, you still get pelted directly in the face by eoten crotch sand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The third eoten's waking head glowers at its dozing head, and slaps it with the broom. With a snort, the second head blinks to wakefulness and growls. The eoten's free hand slaps the first head. 

The two heads growl at one another, but from this distance, you can't make out exactly what they're saying.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The eoten in the sand laughs at the eoten with the broom, pointing at it with a thick finger. The latter climbs to its feet and trudges over to the eoten sitting in the sand, who only laughs harder.

The eoten with the broom growls down at the eoten in the sand, and then begins sweeping the sand off of its legs, inducing a yelp of rage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A second sits upright in the sun, covering its legs in sand. It pats the sand, packing it with its heavy palm. Though it seems engrossed in its efforts, you suspect that its four eyes provide it excellent peripheral vision.

A third beast scratches its back with a broom, yawning with one cavernous mouth as the other snores quietly.

You don't see any other eoten, but there could be others lurking among the stone spires.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The path winds up into the hills, narrowing to little wider than a cart. The cliffs offer a sheer drop down into the crashing sea, the water foaming white where it throws itself against the rocks. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blank sands stretch towards the thin line of the sea on the horizon, broken on occasion by jagged stone spires that jut from the earth. You notice movement among a jumbled group of rocks ahead.

A group of eoten are lounging among the stone pillars. One of the two-headed beasts drowses, its eyes closed, its chins drooping against its wiry-haired chest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Each eoten scratches one of their heads. "Maybe we should let little softlings pass?"

"Food not worth trouble. Not worth sharp blades and swift arrows." The other nods.

      <DefaultText>&lt;xg&gt;One&lt;/xg&gt; of the eotens swings at the other, a wild blow that glances off of the second's shoulder before crashing into the rock, shaking the cliffs.

      <DefaultText>As [Specified 0] guides you towards the eoten, one of the beast's heads snaps towards the two of you, perhaps having caught the movement out of the corner of its eye.

With surprising speed, the beast lifts a massive clump of sand from off of its buried crotch and hurls it at [Specified 0]. Though the projectile disintegrates in the air, your compatriot still get pelted directly in the face by eoten crotch sand.</DefaultText>

The creatures stomp towards you.</DefaultText>
