      <DefaultText>A shadow passes over Tekēhu's skin and his hair begins to drip ink.

      <DefaultText>"I will pray for the day, the hour - when we can beat our swords into plowshares and let art tell of our deeds."

Tekēhu blows across his open palm. Water droplets coalesce in the air, taking on the shape of a fish and a hawk. He smiles with pride, looking through the form and toward Maia.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>107</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I can get behind that." 

Grunting in approval, Maia steps closer to Tekēhu and envelops him in a fierce embrace. The water form loses its shape and evaporates, coating them both in a fine mist of dewdrops.</DefaultText>

      <ID>118</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I'm wrong to let that sort of talk bleed into civilian life.

"I fight so that folks won't need to have skin as thick as mine." 

She lowers her hands to her sides, palms turned out. Ishiza mirrors the gesture with his wings, though it seems less deliberate.</DefaultText>
