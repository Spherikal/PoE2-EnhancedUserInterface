      <DefaultText>You tell Aloth about the past life you glimpsed in Ruāsare's soul - about her long-ago meeting with Thaos, his warning about the ruins, her decision to execute him, and her mandate to the Wahaki to defend their territory from outsiders. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Then the Wahaki are the Painted Masks.

"They've been serving the Leaden Key's interests for two thousand years without even knowing it." Aloth blinks, working through the implications. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's like what he told the Glanfathans. 

"Bet he didn't expect they'd kill him for it. Would've loved to see the look on his face."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Di verus? That was the same story he told the Glanfathans. At least the Wahaki made him pay for his lie."</DefaultText>

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Few plans work out perfectly. Thaos got the Wahaki to help him guard the ruins - that's what matters."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yet over time, they became hostile toward all outsiders." A thoughtful furrow splits his brow.</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Is it?" His frown deepens.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's a logical extension of what they learned from Thaos."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"With all that's changing in Deadfire, who knows what they'd believe in another few hundred years?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Stories and messages change. Thaos only had clarity about his because Woedica reincarnated him whole every time."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Look around. Their environment surely pushed them in that direction."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's not just that the Wahaki misread Thaos' original message. It fundamentally changed them." He purses his lips. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They went from being a large and well-connected tribe to a much smaller one defined by isolationism."

Worry burrows into the shadows and creases on his face. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But don't you wonder if bearing that message was part of what made Thaos who he was?" He raises an eyebrow and falls quiet for a moment. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, but it didn't stop there."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps they would have reacted differently to it without Thaos' intervention."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Or who they'll be."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And this has got you thinking again about the consequences of your intervention."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But what does this have to do with you?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You can't attribute two thousand years' worth of change to one incident."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You know me too well, [Player Name]." His wry grin doesn't quite banish his air of melancholy.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've been chasing the Leaden Key, trying to undo the harm they've caused. 

"But what if I'm only making matters worse?" Private agony muffles his voice. His breath catches in his throat as the full weight of his words hits him.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Might... I be to blame? Have I made a grievous mistake in getting involved?"

Through his scars and lines and newfound purpose, you catch a glimpse of the Aloth you knew five years ago - scared, alone, and desperate for direction. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps not, but I suppose we'll never know what would have happened without Thaos' meddling."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No. If you didn't try at all, you'd be responsible for the harm the Leaden Key continues doing."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Consider how poorly Thaos understood the Wahaki. How much less do you understand the Leaden Key?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>51</ID>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thaos accomplished his goals, just not the way he originally planned. Your problem is looking for specific, immediate results."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You don't have to reform the Leaden Key - without Thaos, it will change in time."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose that's true. It's an intimidating thought, but a heartening one, too." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Where to begin? So little that I expected to find a conclave of black-clad minions in the middle of the Deadfire." He utters a self-deprecating laugh, then falls silent, thinking.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When you put it that way, mine does sound like a rather flimsy excuse, doesn't it?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right. Perhaps I've been unrealistic in my expectations."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>61</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And I should stand by and simply allow it to happen?" He's quiet for a moment, thinking.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>He chuckles. "That's what I was afraid you'd say."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps it was wrong of me to assume that I knew the proper course of action. Or, indeed, how to bring it about."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well. Knowing the gods came from kith, it's easy to see how the world became such a... complicated place."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was always too comfortable to leave the hard decisions to others. To simply follow along." 

He cocks his head in reflection and inclines it toward you.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I can't imagine he thought he'd destroy an entire generation, either. Not in the beginning, anyway."

He clasps his hands and presses his lips together, trying to formulate a thought.

When he opens his mouth again, he speaks as if he's choosing his words carefully.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The strange thing is, this whole ordeal has given me some sympathy for Thaos.

"Not that I condone his actions, of course." He quickly clears his throat. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>He smiles wryly.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"From what you described, it certainly didn't seem that way, but I'll concede that Thaos was wilier than most."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They're living in Engwithan ruins. Thaos certainly didn't intend that."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>76</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, I don't suppose he did." His frown deepens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I've been hunting the Leaden Key, trying to shape them into a force for good.

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>80</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I must say, that's a disconcerting thought. If that's true, then every decision we make is fraught. Nothing is certain."

      <ID>87</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We're always trying to impose our own order or vision upon it.
