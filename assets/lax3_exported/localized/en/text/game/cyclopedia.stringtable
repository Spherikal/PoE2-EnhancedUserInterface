      <DefaultText>Observers are the living eyes of the Oracle of Wael. After exiting the central body, these sentries single-mindedly patrol in search of trespassers, meddlers, or escapees. Any information they gather is fed back to the Oracle of Wael over time. To address any matters requiring immediate attention, an unseen vocal gland can stimulate a piercing cry of alarm. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While it's true that spiderlings cluster and clump together out of a shared desire for safety in numbers, this also affords them greater aggression in numbers. Like a moving carpet of fangs and venom, a spiderling swarm can overwhelm even massive foes with minimal resistance. Knit together in this unified mass, spiderlings employ tactics not unlike an army - dividing their numbers when necessary to mitigate harm and outflank an opponent, gradually wearing them down for the kill. Only once they grow to adulthood do spiderlings grow competitive and territorial. Until then, their swarm presents a problem beyond the power of any single bullet to solve. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In Vithrack society, wardens serve a coercive leadership role - overseeing the operations of a hive in order to maintain harmony. They are also charged with the hive's defense against spiderling swarms or other pests that compete for space in their tunnel ecosystem.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In Vithrack society, the brutes are tasked with protecting the colony - placing special emphasis on the hatchery. These seasoned fighters are also equipped with the same reproductive catalysts as broodmothers, which they exude with care to strengthen the integrity of eggs and aid in the gradual development of the young. Though they approach their work with care and attention to detail, Vithrack brutes won't hesitate to launch a violent attack if the safety of their charges is compromised.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vithrack luminaries serve a defensive role similar to the brutes of their kind, though their superior intellect compels them to act as spellcasters rather than brawlers. They specialize in disrupting waves of enemies, softening up their prey for a brute's killing blow. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Spores are notoriously adaptive, capable of adjusting their offspring to survive a particular environment or set of challenges. Luminous spores were first discovered in the private laboratories of archmagi, resulting from a combination of tight confinement and exposure to arcane energies. On some instinctive level, the imprisoned spores know when magical absorbtion and redirection will make for critical survival advantages in their next generation, and tailor their offspring appropriately. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tentacles sloughing off the body of Wael occasionally coalesce into dangerous, semi-intelligent creatures. The Hand Occult employs keepers to dispose of these cast-off limbs, though long shifts and skeleton crews mean that anomalies go unnoticed from time to time. The tentacles prioritize simple and efficient biological designs, likely to escape their would-be captors in a timely manner. The shimmering dreambeast is Wael's unconscious approximation of a hound, though its evasion and camoflage talents surpass those of most common beasts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Oracle serves many roles, all of them fiercely committed to the stewardship of Wael's inert form. As an extension of Wael's immune system, it violently subdues any outside influence from trespassing on the god body. It also coordinates the development and expansion of Wael's atypical biology, inhibiting the growth of tentacles, eyes, and other appendages to impose a semblance of order among anarchy. The Oracle's origins are a mystery, but its loyalty is beyond question.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The memory hoarder is both prisoner and imprisoned -  the combined recollections of many minds into a single tortured body. Some speculate that the agonized shrieks persistently bellowing forth are the result of trapped personalities, lifetimes' worth of neglect, and memories of agony which haunt the hoarder day and night. No matter the reason, the results are the same - the hoarder's call heralds a bottomless craving for forgetfulness to all those unfortunate enough to hear it. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Notoriously tough and resilient, common theory holds that moon spiders are influenced by Eora's twin moons, and that their affinity for the lunar cycles grants them their unique skills. In addition to being capable predators, moon spiders are fiercely defensive and protective, able to strengthen their outbound warriors and restore any damage to their eggs. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Juvenile moon spiders lack the defensive properties of their elders, though their bite is no less wicked. The adults are so protective that the death of a nearby offspring triggers a swelling of confidence and rage, spurring them to defend the remainder of the nest. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>At one point these creatures were lagufaeth, but research and experimentation manipulated the raw material of their bodies to assume a shape unintended by any natural process. Scavengers of Vision are watchful, strong, and unpredictable. They have been known to stand in observant silence until death or launch into feverish bouts of aggression. It's unclear if their intelligence registers anything beyond pain and confusion. What instinct and cleverness they possessed as lagufaeth is gone, and only madness remains. </DefaultText>
