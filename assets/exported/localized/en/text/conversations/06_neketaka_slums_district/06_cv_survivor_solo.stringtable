      <DefaultText>"Wait, I'm not looking for trouble. Not anymore, I mean. And I've not got a weapon on you. See?"

He raises his hands to show his sword is sheathed.</DefaultText>

      <ID>3</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It's just, you're the first body I've bumped into in days. That's actually breathing, I mean. Could it be you're delving for forgotten treasures, same as me?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>9</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, right! It's safe to make for the rivers then. Or as safe as it's likely to get. I'll head downward now."

With a wince, he hefts his pack from the ground.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>10</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I scaled down from the cliffs. But midway, the rocks turned slick."

He scratches at a patch of dried muck on the side of his neck.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I packed provisions enough for two weeks. Started rationing when things looked grim, after the first odd days. I-I don't know beyond that."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He rubs the stale-smelling sweat from the back of his neck, face slack with relief.

His eyes crinkle in brief uncertainty. But it ebbs just as quickly.</DefaultText>

      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Take heed if you've plans to trudge deeper north. I only glimpsed it once, but whatever nightmare lurks near the falls of the pit - it's incredibly massive. And surely just as mean."

Then he's gone, easing cautiously into the darkness.</DefaultText>

      <ID>15</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Best bet's the rivers at the base of the pit. They flow beneath the outcrops so they must dump into the sea."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He eyes the ripped toe of his boot as he scuffs it against the stone beneath his feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ondra's lure hardly seems worth it now. Suppose I fell for the bait though, didn't I? A fabled temple full of treasures - my ass." </DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>Too sore to rush for it, he secures his pack with careful motions and, with a final nod to you, eases out into the darkness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>His boots are slicked with grime. His clothes are filthy and rumpled from several days' wear, and his neck and hands are smeared in places with mud.

A pack rests at his heels, empty enough to have flopped into itself. It likely carries no more than his dwindling supplies. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The trouble's been reaching the base. The western caves wind downward, but they're riddled. Infested. Walking them's not been safe."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's darker than a dargul's armpit in there." He peers into the cavern, wrinkling his nose.</DefaultText>

      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You wouldn't think to leave me in the dark, would you? You'll return? Alive, I mean." 

His eyes gleam from the fire as he searches your face, intent.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Smell that? Like chum. Must be a heap of grubs. Dead ahead."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then I'll make it. I know I'd hoped, but honestly, I didn't really expect you'd help me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm loath to admit it, but look, I'm too desperate not to. I've found not a single trinket and no end to this pit since I first crawled down. I'd thought to follow the rivers out, but the caves are crawling with grubs."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Right. I'll wait here. And you'll return for me. Won't you?"

He nods in answer to his own question, but a deep worry furrows across his brow. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Mayhaps we'll meet again in the darkness?"

He tosses you a concerned glance over his shoulder.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A bead of sweat trickles down the side of his neck.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I might ask the same to you, friend. Not everyone longs to die in their own bed. I just... Well, I thought I'd have more time."</DefaultText>

With a grunt, he passes you the trembling flame.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Thank you, friend."

Keen relief gushes from his chest, shuddering the flames in his white-knuckled grip.</DefaultText>
