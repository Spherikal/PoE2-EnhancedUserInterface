      <DefaultText>The patter of footfalls to either side demand your attention as xaurips appear, their simple spears held at the ready. 

The foremost reptilian wilder, a dull-scaled creature with yellow eyes, howls angrily at you, gesturing at the trap. The others hiss, revealing jagged, mismatched teeth.

The xaurips charge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You make to continue your journey, only to stumble over a vine that appears before your feet. With a nearby crack, a cloud of acrid greenish gas bursts into the air around you. It burns where it settles on your skin, and you close your watering eyes against the sudden pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You make to continue your journey, only to watch helplessly as [Slot 0] stumbles over a vine ahead of you. You hear a nearby crack, and a small cloud of green gas bursts into being, obscuring [Slot 0]'s features. Coughing with eyes closed tight, [Slot 0] doubles over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes you only a few moments to make sense of the chaos. No blood spatters suggest it was not a fight, and you easily identify the clawed prints of xaurips. The tracks seem recent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Something about the curve of the path ahead of you gives you pause. With the obscured sight lines, you recognize this as a good site for an ambush.

At the same time, you don't hear anything out of the ordinary. Actually, you don't hear anything at all... no hum of insects, no rustling of animals. Even the air has stilled.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you make your way along the road, you notice the light dimming, as if a shadow has fallen over you. You glance around, unsure of where it's coming from. The air feels thick, pregnant with unseen energy.

      <DefaultText>A sharp intake of breath follows a quiet thump, and you look towards the sounds to find a feathered dart protruding from [Specified 0]'s side. Your companion blinks at the projectile for a moment before tearing it free and throwing it aside. 

[Specified 0] stumbles sideways, then points past you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a quiet nuzzle, [Player Animal Companion] sets off. Shortly thereafter, the xaurips stop their fighting at the sound of a noise some distance away.
