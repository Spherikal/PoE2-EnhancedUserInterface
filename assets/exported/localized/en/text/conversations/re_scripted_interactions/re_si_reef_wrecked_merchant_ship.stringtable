      <DefaultText>You're sailing past a reef when [Specified 3] shouts out, pointing to port. There lists a ship stranded in the middle, perched on a narrow shoal. It tips and rolls with the passing waves. 

Hanging from its mast is a blue flag showing an image of a crescent moon sinking beneath the waves.

Your crew gathers around, murmuring in low, excited voices.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the ship settles, [SkillCheck 0] cries out, slips free, and falls flailing among the sharp spines of coral beneath the water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crew begins to disperse, mumbling. [Specified 0] scuffs a boot against the deck and scowls at [Specified 1]'s and [Specified 2]'s retreating backs.

"There might have been something good. It never hurts to look." [Specified 0] shrugs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your grip holds. 

Once the ship settles, you resume your climb and make it to the safety of the deck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Just then, a large wave crashes against the ship, knocking it violently against the reef. The hull splinters with a loud crack.

[Specified 0] gapes.

[Specified 2] half-turns. "That's why [Player Name]'s the captain."

[Specified 0]'s face darkens.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ship is deserted - you don't even find corpses. If the ship had a skiff, it's missing, too.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] rushes to the railing. "Captain, that's a Giftbearer ship! No telling what sorts of treasures it's got."

[Specified 1] snorts. "Giftbearers carry sentimental junk. Worthless stuff. No, that's a smuggler's ship. It's a classic disguise."

[Specified 2] spits into the water. "Then it's a fucking stupid one. Giftbearers only visit landlocked settlements. That's a trap."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It's not enough. As the ship settles, you slam into its side. Your grip fails, and you plunge into the water. Sharp agony blossoms through your torso, and you emerge back onto the shoal, blood dripping onto the rocks from a deep gash in your side. You tear a long shard of coral from between your ribs and drop it into the water.</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>You pull yourself up, using bent planks and barnacles for holds. You've almost reached the main deck when a wave slams against the ship. You hear a crash from somewhere below as the vessel rocks. Your legs slip out from under you, and your fingers dig into wet lumber.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You slide a crate of junk aside and find a trapdoor underneath. Within rests a small chest brimming with golden scellings.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But then you notice scuff marks along the deck. As if the box of junk has been moved repeatedly over the same spot.

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] fixes a pensive frown on the wreck. "No offense, captain, but the servants of Ondra collect things people want to forget and consign them to the sea. Anything Giftbearers might be carrying would be stuff nobody wants."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The wreck lists on the water, rocking with each wave that strikes it. The planks near the waterline seem cracked and splintered. You doubt the craft will remain intact tomorrow.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ain't a trap, captain. Ship be too smashed to shit for that. Might be too smashed to shit for salvage, too." Serafen scratches the back of his head as he peers at the vessel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You row the skiff above the reefs, the waves tossing it, the bottom of the small boat occasionally scraping across the jagged structure below.

You tie off on a snag of coral next to the wreck. The water is rough and the hull slick with brine, but you're able to find purchase between the shifting planks.</DefaultText>
