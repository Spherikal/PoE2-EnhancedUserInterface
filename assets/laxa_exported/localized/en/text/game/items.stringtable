      <DefaultText>This necklace is the yield of combining a pair of bizarre artifacts into an elegant piece of jewelry. Though recovered worlds apart from each other, the pieces shared a common shape and aura of power. Separately, they thrummed with heat and bottled energy. Fused together, they feel somehow stronger than the sum of their parts. Distortions in the metal are likely the result of a fire.

A section of the metal shows signs of a third piece missing, either melted or snapped free of its sister parts. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This gem feels like a lump of polished ice. A flaw just beneath the surface seems to follow you the longer you handle it. Tales woven around the so-called "Eye of Rymrgand" all share a central theme: that no one carries it for long. Every legend involving an intrepid hero falling into possession of the gem invariably ends with a tragic disappearance or doomed sea voyage. Some theories posit that the gem was snapped from an icicle in Rymrgand's White Void, and that its tireless search to return home draws mortals to the same dark fate. No matter the truth of such stories, the gem has a potent influence over the bearer. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This piece of the Godhammer Bomb hums with divine power. Its existence is something of a paradox, as the bomb it belonged to successfully detonated in 2808 AI. The combination of Magran's blessing and historic significance make this trinket a rare find. Even though this catalyst never technically triggered the explosion on Evon Dewr Bridge, it thrums with the fire of the Godhammer and seems eager to fulfill its promise of destruction. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In the years prior to the Royal Deadfire Company's arrival, the Wahaki hunter Metani led numerous storied hunts across the islands. Said to be blessed by Ngati with unnatural cunning, Metani favored trickery in his hunts, luring monstrous sea beasts into carefully-laid traps. One such stratagem won him this trophy, a harpoon carved from the longest tusk of a qilutaalik. Over time, he etched along its length images of the creatures bested with it.

When the Rauataians swept into the Deadfire, Metani took up Ngati's Tusk against them, eager to test his prowess against the invaders. Nothing prepared him for the iron armada, however, and his small boat disappeared in the blast from a water-borne bomb. The Tusk was lost, reclaimed by the sea. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Embroidered with stylized stelgaers, spiders, and boars, this cape was awarded to you upon being named Champion of the Hunt in the Kazuwari Crucible games. While a helmet is the traditional prize awarded to the victor, you are not the first godlike to win the games. For champions with god-touched brows such as yours, this one-size-fits-all cape is given instead of the usual helm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In addition to protecting the wearerâ€™s head, face, and neck, this crested helm marks those who have risen in the rank and esteem of the Crucible. Decorative engravings lend the wearer a stoic aspect, and the open eyeholes emphasize the need to maintain focus in the heat of battle. </DefaultText>
