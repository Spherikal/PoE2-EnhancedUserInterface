      <DefaultText>"Whoo-wee! About time we took a breather. My feet are blistered something fierce."

Hands braced on her knees for support, she leans forward and sucks in a breath of fresh air. Her eyes never leave your face. A rosy flush slowly brightens her cheeks, and she beams you a wide, brash grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I guess it's the nature of light to want to best the darkness, but you can't have balance like that." Head downcast, she thumbs the edge of her sickle thoughtfully.</DefaultText>

      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That what you call a woman of seven and twenty? Or do you mean to say I'm immature - better suited to another mayhaps?"

Mirthfully, her eyes gleam - studying your lips, your nose, your chin - as she tips her head back. Then, to make matters worse, she winks.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>56</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I've not done much more than that. And I don't use the real ugly words."

      <DefaultText>"No use in fearing what's natural. Life isn't one long line, it's cyclical. You got to shed the old to become the new." Her head shakes.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>65</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You sound like my high priestess when she's debating slapping the tar out of me." 

With a heavy-hearted sigh, she toes at the ground. Kicks a couple times, then stops.</DefaultText>

      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And on what does it depend?" Sidling closer, almost hesitantly, Xoti touches the toes of her boots to yours.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>A stretch of heavy silence passes before Xoti awkwardly clears her throat.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>71</ID>
      <DefaultText>A shocked sound tries to escape from her throat, but you swallow it down - invading, conquering, demanding until she softens against the hard line of your body and timidly returns the kiss.

Then she throws herself into it with enthusiasm, clutching at your shoulders and neck. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'll take that as a no... Thanks for letting me down easy."

With agitation, she fingers the flat of her sickle, and you can see that her nails are near bloodless, dirty, and bitten to the quick.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>73</ID>
      <DefaultText>When you break away, she tries to follow your lips with a little growl. But just as abruptly, a heat suffuses her cheeks as she remembers herself and glances furtively around.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>74</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Good, Gaun! That was... I mean, I..." She fans herself, head ducked with embarrassment even as her kissed-swollen lips quirk prettily.

When she looks back up, her brown eyes are heavy with a darkness. A depth of longing.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>75</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You going to kiss me now, Watcher? 'Cause if you were... I guess I might not complain."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>81</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You sure know how to woo a gal. Don't you, Watcher?"

Xoti puffs out a breath, but despite her momentary pique, she's quick to lick her lips, her gaze straying to your mouth expectantly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <ID>86</ID>
      <DefaultText>"After that, I read all the doctrines of Gaun - anything and everything I could get my hands on."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The twelve books of Nyrwith. Plus, the epistles from the minor prophets. A lot of them aren't a part of today's canonization, but that doesn't mean they're wrong."

She crosses her arms over her chest, expression pinched.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Xoti leans forward, clearly intent to collide with your lips. But you turn your face aside just before she's able to touch mouth to mouth. Instead, you plant a sweet kiss over the ridge of her cheek. 

Surprised, she jerks, fingers falling away from where she'd reached for you - her entire face heating to a fine scarlet as she retreats a step back.</DefaultText>
