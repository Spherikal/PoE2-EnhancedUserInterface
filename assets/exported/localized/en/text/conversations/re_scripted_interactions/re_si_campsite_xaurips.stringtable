      <DefaultText>The desert wind carries a sibilant susurrus to your ears from the canyon ahead. Punctuated by cracks and pops, it reminds you of eggs on a hot pan or a fire in dry brush. The low growl that accompanies it, however, raises the hair on the back of your neck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You carefully enter the desert canyon, keeping to the shade cast by the tall standing stones. 

Ahead of you, a group of xaurips chant, hopping back and forth on skinny legs, shaking their spears. Nested between them rises the black, leathery form of a drake. The creature's wings rise above it as it tears at the corpse of a boar at its feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurip silently watch you back away. Once you're well away, they begin chittering amongst themselves. A few turn back to their games, but others take up watch positions around the periphery of the rock.

You leave the wilder behind.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurips' beady eyes widen at the sudden appearance of so near a threat, and they stumble over each other, chittering and screeching, as they try to back away. 

The band breaks, xaurips discarding their weapons as they flee towards the jungle.

      <DefaultText>With a mighty twist of its muscular neck, the drake tears the boar in half. It rises up on its legs, lifting its head, and swallows the back half of the boar whole. The lump of the animal visibly travels down the reptile's throat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;xg&gt;One&lt;/xg&gt; of the xaurips hops forward. It tears its feathered headdress from its head and tosses it aside. It drops its staff a moment later and spreads its arms before the drake. The large beast peers down at the xaurip, then, with a flash of movement, eats the small wilder in a single bite. 

The other xaurips cheer, banging their spears against their shields. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The drake methodically plucks up the remaining xaurips, consuming each in turn. It seems to struggle with the last one - small as a xaurip is, the group was almost a match for the beast's gullet.

It curls up and closes its eyes, basking in the warmth of the sun and a full belly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurip roots through its pouch, glancing between you and the contents of its bag. You're not sure whether it's suspicious of you or trying to judge its own belongings. It may be both.

Eventually it settles on something and withdraws it. It takes a few furtive hops towards you, sets a small dragon figurine before you, and then hops back.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurip shaman steps forward, feathered headdress swaying. It chitters, points towards the horizon, then points towards a pouch hanging from its waist.

The other xaurips nod.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You run a hand across [Player Animal Companion]'s back before setting the animal forward. Your furred friend moves into the center of the circle as one of the xaurips places a grub on the ground. 

[Player Animal Companion] circles the grub, and it slowly slithers towards the beast, snapping its tiny mandibles.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As the grubs begin to wiggle away, the xaurips initially respond with blank confusion. They look to one another, look to the grubs, look to their shaman, then look back to the grubs.

The shaman chirps and growls, pointing a bony finger, and the xaurips rush after their grubs in the hopes of collecting them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurips yelp in surprise as the grubs turn on them. They slash with claws and stab with spears, killing their erstwhile pets.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurips stare, utterly mesmerized, as the grubs wiggle in synchronized waves. One begins slapping out a simple rhythm on its scaled chest. The rest of the xaurips begin to bob their heads, shift from foot to foot, and finally begin to dance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The xaurips' beady eyes widen at the sudden appearance of so near a threat, and they stumble over each other, chittering and screeching, as they try to back away. 

The band breaks, xaurips discarding their weapons as they flee towards the jungle.

You collect what they abandoned and continue your travels.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You've never seen less impressed wilder. One shakes its head, resting a disappointed palm on its snout. Another sits down, cradling its head in its hands.</DefaultText>
