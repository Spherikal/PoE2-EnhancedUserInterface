      <DefaultText>"We're full up, I'm afraid, if you're looking for lodging. You'll have to hope there's room at the tavern."

This family scribe offers you a pleasant smile, but seems preoccupied by other matters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"We do indeed - forgive me if I mistook you for a tenant. There are quarters set aside upstairs. Passers-by with a bit of extra coin will find a welcome cot and a meal. This is a... temporary measure, of course."

She clears her throat and glances away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, as they say, business can always be better, yes? I'm sure I needn't bore you with the details..."

The scribe bites her lower lip and diverts her gaze.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now that the Bardattos have pulled some strings, contracts and investment opportunities are pouring in at an unprecedented rate. I've never been so busy!" 

She beams with pride.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's not my place to share the dealings of the Valera family, but this is all rather public..."

She frowns and glances around the house self-consciously.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Suffice it to say that a family in want of coin might find alternate means of securing their finances. In the case of this estate, that means renting the occasional room. No shame in making a practical sacrifice."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I've said enough... speak with Atello if you have business with the Valera household."

She beckons you on in an anxious, urgent manner.</DefaultText>
