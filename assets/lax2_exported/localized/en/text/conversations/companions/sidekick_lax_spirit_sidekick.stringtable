      <DefaultText>"Finally, a beacon to light this wilderness! I would have words with you." The spirit takes a bold step forward and crosses her arms, studying you with her chin tiled up. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I am remembering things." Ryona opens both of her palms. At first it seems like she's studying her hands, but it seems equally possible that she's admiring the memory of a blade. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Death has darkened the skies, but I see three beacons in the fog. Since you are the closest, I will follow you until I reach another. I hope this is agreeable?" She adjusts her empty scabbard and weighs your reaction. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I can handle myself in a fight, casità. Whatever keeps me bound to this side of death's curtain has also kept my sword hand steady. Sometimes I even bleed - strange, no?" She snorts loudly and hocks a glob of ethereal phlegm at the ground between her feet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You see that faint beacon, on the horizon? Maybe not. I believe it is my old sword. When I am paired with it again, we can go our separate ways." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You do not jest? Then it is a good thing I did not follow the walking god – who knows where I might have ended up?" She looks off to the distance and shivers. A breeze - one which you don't feel - stirs her hair. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I went out hunting alone, but a storm forced me to take shelter in a cave. A pair of eyes studied me from the darkness. Eyes full of hunger and hate." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The beast was famished, and I was an animal trapped in the corner. So I struck a betrayer's bargain: the lives of my friends in exchange for mine. The beast agreed to these terms." </DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I fled the cave. It followed me back to the clearing. My friends were telling stories about the last time I speared a boar. They did not know they had already eaten their last meal.” </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I scrambled from those woods alive, but with screams echoing in my ears. Later I returned to the Republics, did right by the families of the lost. Defended them when I could. But it was never enough. All those deeds never scrubbed a single fleck of blood from my hands." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The next time I stepped into that cave, the beast was waiting for me. I wasn’t strong enough to face it before. I didn’t fare any better on my second try." She squeezes her eyes shut and turns away. </DefaultText>
