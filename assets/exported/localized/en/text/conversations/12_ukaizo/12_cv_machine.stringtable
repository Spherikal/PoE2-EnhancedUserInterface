      <DefaultText>Though the device atop the tower spins in wild, blurring revolutions, the air around it is still and calm. You stand in the eye of the storm which has cordoned off Ondra's Mortar from the rest of Eora for thousands of years. 

You see an antiquated control panel, its levers engaged in positions of activation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The control panel has weathered the millennia better than the rest of the city. A layer of dust covers its elegant glass tubes and engraved copper levers, which appear both intact and fully functional.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your mind is assaulted with complex symbols and postures, most of them beyond your reckoning. 

As the sensation pulls away, you recognize that it left behind - knowledge of watershaping as it existed long ago. Armed with this memory, a capable watershaper might wield the power of their ancestors. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He covers his heart with one hand and lowers his head, muttering a slow and fervent prayer. 

From the broiling madness of the storm, a single drop of water lands on Tekēhu's brow, running down his cheek like a tear. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... I remember!"

He clenches his hands into fists. The storm surges around you as the winds pick up speed. Tekēhu's head snaps back and his eyes squeeze shut in agony, ecstasy, or both.

He rouses at last, shaking a few droplets of moisture from his hair.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nodding, Tekēhu closes his eyes and mutters a prayer to Ngati. The storm intensifies around the tower, but he stands in solemn tranquility.

      <DefaultText>Your focus slips, depositing you back in the present with a wave of nausea.

      <DefaultText>Consciousness returns in a wave as the last of the machine's energy dissipates.
