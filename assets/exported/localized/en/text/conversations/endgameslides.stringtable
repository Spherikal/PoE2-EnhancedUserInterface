      <DefaultText>As Eothas' voice fades, the enormity of what you've accomplished sinks in. You have confronted a god. You have rediscovered the ancient city where the Wheel was forged.

And you have seen the Wheel shattered.

What comes next is uncertain, but already the legend spreads of the Watcher who survived Ondra's Mortar and stood toe-to-toe with Eothas.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No sooner has Berath spoken than you feel yourself dissolve. It is not an unpleasant sensation - something between falling asleep and drifting on a warm current.

Your essence is pulled through the adra, where it mingles with the stuff of thousands of other souls. Your thoughts, your memories, even your identity as the Watcher fade like a dream.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In the days sailing back from Ukaizo, Edér keeps mostly to himself, reflecting upon the new, fragile existence his god has forced upon the world. He decides that if he knows one thing about the gods, it is that they are already plotting, and greater calamities will certainly follow. Ultimately he chooses to remain with you on the Defiant, knowing if any mortal is to have the final word in a conflict with the gods, it will be the Watcher of Caed Nua.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In the days sailing back from Ukaizo, Edér finds himself disillusioned with all gods, his own above all. Where the gods have touched Deadfire, he sees only destruction, loss, and emptiness. He casts off all symbols of Eothas, and even begins refusing to use his name. Ultimately, he chooses to remain with you on the Defiant, knowing if any mortal is to have the final word in a conflict with the gods, it will be the Watcher of Caed Nua.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Edér returns to Hasongo where he reunites with Bearn, the son of his former lover Elafa. Although Bearn regrets not having joined the Army of Eothas, he accepts that he tried to go about it the wrong way. Likewise, he comes to idolize his new "uncle," who has truly marched in the Lighted Path. Together they set about bolstering Eothas’ following in Deadfire, and preparing for the greater conflict Edér believes is soon to come.</DefaultText>

Distraught upon learning that he has truly missed the chance to help Eothas in his greatest moment, Bearn spurns Edér’s offer of guidance. He disappears from Hasongo soon after, leaving Edér alone there with only memories of the boy’s mother for company. Eventually, Edér finds his way back to rejoin you on the Defiant.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Edér returns to Hasongo where he reunites with Bearn, the son of his former lover Elafa. The boy takes heart in Edér’s account that Eothas and all the other gods were false, petty, and unworthy of the love of kith. Realizing how close he came to dying for this cause, Bearn finds renewed purpose in working alongside his "uncle" to repair the many scars left upon Deadfire by the gods. Under Edér’s guidance, Bearn grows into the kind of irreverent, stubborn hothead that would have made his mother proud, and Edér visits her gravesite often to tell her so.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eventually, your soul reforms and finds its way into a small, crawling thing of fur and claws. You know the world by sound and scent, as food and danger. The concerns of gods and nations are beyond you.

It is a simple and satisfactory existence, though your mind can conceive of no other.

Whether it is a long one will depend upon the Watcher Berath chooses in your stead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your stand against Eothas lasts no longer than it takes you to declare it.

In less than the span of a breath, the god absorbs your soul into his adra body, where it mingles with the thousands already there.

It is a strange afterlife - a place of sleepy peace for some and unrelenting tedium for others.

For you, it is a place of stasis.</DefaultText>

He sails from island to island as an emissary from the gods to the Huana people. The tribes welcome his message and use it to bridge their traditions across the archipelago. Huana unity has never been stronger.

Tekēhu rides this momentum, leading by example and teaching his people to rely on each other instead of on omens. His message is an upheaval of norms, but it's as embraced and beloved as he is.</DefaultText>

No sooner does she return to active duty than she voices her frustrations over some of the more underhanded tactics she witnessed - and carried out - in the name of the homeland. 

Her voice carries all the way to the ranga nui, who reminds his admirals that battles are won by superior tactics, but war is a battle of precedent - and winning is not always a victory.

The following morning, he's gone, leaving only a crude stick figure rendering of Eothas scrawled into the hull to mark his passage.

As you travel the Deadfire, you find her sleeping better and laughing more often. When the time comes for her to return to her temple in Neketaka, it's with a clear wistfulness and much lip biting on her part.

She leaves you with her sickle and a hastily scrawled note. It reads: &lt;i&gt;A keepsake from a path once walked. Remember me, Watcher. For I will forever dream of you.&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

It is some months later when she pens you a missive.

But as you all travel, Edér grows increasingly uncomfortable with her attempts to engender his affection, until he finally takes her aside and sets her straight.

He's not interested in a sheltered, overzealous little girl, he explains in so many words. After that, Xoti turns a cold shoulder to him, sometimes "forgetting" to heal him in the chaos of battle.

Or so she claims.</DefaultText>

With no friends left among the Vailian Trading Company, Pallegina is banished from the Republics.

Seen as a Vailian by the Huana and an outcast by her own people, she finds the Deadfire cold and unwelcoming. Spirit broken, she eventually boards a ship bound for Defiance Bay and is not heard from again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Vailian Trading Company is initially furious with Pallegina for her support of the Watcher during the Príncipi conquest of Ukaizo.

They make a show of banishing her from the order for a time, but they quickly realize that Captain Furrante has no intention of pushing the Company from the Deadfire.

Within a few months, she is readmitted to the brotherhood, though the ducs ensure she spends a year performing the most onerous assignments available.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Vailian Trading Company is furious with Pallegina for her support of the Watcher during the Príncipi conquest of Ukaizo.

Their fury intensifies when Aeldys' pirates triple their attacks on all merchant ships in the Deadfire.

Instead of removing Pallegina from the brotherhood, the ducs assign her to guard the most vulnerable ships in the Company fleet.

Five months into her assignment, Pallegina goes down with the Vengiatta men Aimora. Her body is never found.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Vailian Trading Company is initially furious when they learn that Pallegina had assisted the Watcher in claiming Ukaizo.

In the chaotic aftermath, the Company takes a more nuanced view of Pallegina's actions. The turmoil in the region allows the well-organized Company to seize a number of valuable assets from their competitors.

Though Pallegina is not rewarded for her actions, nor is she punished. The ducs and songretta agree to "forget" her support of the Watcher. She is quietly reassigned to duty in the Vailian Republics, an order she gladly obeys.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Following her triumphant return to the Republics, Pallegina is assigned to be the personal guard of the Ducess Spirento. She excels in this role, and is favored by the ducess above all other members of the brotherhood.

Their close relationship causes friction with the ducess' husband, the Canta Miraba. His impotent annoyance becomes the subject of courtly gossip and the inspiration for a well-received farce staged at the biggest theatre in Ozia.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina renews her relationship with Giacolo, corresponding with him regularly and even meeting with the old animancer once or twice a year.

Though she does not understand the intricate details of his research, she reads his letters and responds with great enthusiasm.

Her brothers and even the ducs themselves note that Pallegina's demeanor is always warmer on the days when she receives a letter. Rumors even spread that some of the brothers have seen her smile.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Despite her good fortunes in the Deadfire, Pallegina mourns the loss of Giacolo for years.

She cursed herself for not finding her friend sooner, for not protecting him from Captain Tatzatl and his crew.

On a few lonely nights, Pallegina composes letters to the Watcher, asking what more they could have done to save him. They are never sent.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Although she had made it through her second adventure with the Watcher, Pallegina regrets that she never found her childhood friend, Giacolo.

She searches far and wide, across the Deadfire and beyond, but never finds him.</DefaultText>

Your ship is overwhelmed, and you with it. It takes only moments for the entire vessel to be swept beneath the waves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you sink into the depths, the din of the storm recedes above you. Soon it is little more than a muffled rumble. You are alone in the dark, awaiting death.

Your lungs begin to burn. In the distance, you can see a dim light making its way toward you. A plaintive tune accompanies it, a woman's voice. Somehow it calms you, in spite of your circumstance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The light reaches you. It is attached to a large angler fish, its scales glittering in the darkness. The woman's singing ceases as the voice speaks to your mind.

&lt;i&gt;We had high hopes for you, Watcher of Caed Nua.&lt;/i&gt;

Your body betrays you, drawing in a large gulp of sea water. Your chest spasms. The pain is unbearable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>&lt;i&gt;Be still now. Forget your pain. Forget your struggle.&lt;/i&gt;

The angler fish's light begins to dim and turn sideways, but perhaps it is your sight that is failing, your body that is turning. You can't seem to think straight.

&lt;i&gt;Forget.&lt;/i&gt;

The sensation of pain begins to fade. Then all sensation fades.</DefaultText>
