      <DefaultText>"Well, what have we here? A little sloop - lost and alone in the storm."

      <DefaultText>The captain tilts his head, staring impassively as the wind and rain whip at his scarred face. Even across the distance, you can make out the roughness of his expression - muscles in his jaw bulging. </DefaultText>
