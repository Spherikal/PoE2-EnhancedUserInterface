      <DefaultText>"I am Atsura. Grand secretary of the Royal Deadfire Company and special emissary of the ranga nui of Rauatai."

      <DefaultText>It's as though a cold wind has blown over the deck. At the mention of Magran's Teeth, the Rauataian sailors stare at you in shock and horror. Those who are not frozen with their mouths agape are whispering fearfully amongst themselves.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>126</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Forgive my compatriots. Magran's Teeth is a volcanic chain along the northeastern edge of Deadfire.

      <ID>129</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Were you on better terms with the Huana, I would suggest asking their queen.

      <DefaultText>"All I know is Magran's Teeth is a volcanic chain along the northeastern edge of Deadfire.
