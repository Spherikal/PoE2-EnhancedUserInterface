      <DefaultText>"We are stretched thin. The Storm Speaker did much to help, but much of the town has flooded. 

"Now we are awash in homeless citizens and stranded merchants. To say nothing of the &lt;i&gt;cultists&lt;/i&gt; out there..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I would not wish to send a man who was not ready for a fight, but... perhaps I have done a poor job of explaining the situation."

Savia sighs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Gorecci Street is in the western part of town. Just walk until you hit water.

"We don't need a bloodbath. I'm sure there's a peaceful solution to resolve this. I'd appreciate your looking for it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Eccosi? Why should I do that? To show my appreciation for his aim?

      <DefaultText>"Riggere's gone. I can only assume he wasn't half as drunk as he was putting on.

Merla. That rum-soaked rat is lucky I don't have the time to waste on him right now."</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ac, of course. Here you are, to see the damage and ask polite questions- No, do not say anything. It has been a very long day." 

Savia's baleful glower slides away from you, to the smoking gap in the wall of the nearby cell. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Now I have Ilari's people making trouble up on Gorecci Street.

      <DefaultText>"We lost no one to the storm, but many homes have been damaged. And the people are terrified of this... 'giant' the scouts reported.

"It is chaos, pure and simple. But things might have been far worse."

      <DefaultText>"I do appreciate what you have done for me. So, if you will vouch for Riggere, I will lower the fine. 

"Three hundred pieces will cover what he owes at the tavern."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps I should raise it. How is it Riggere has caught your interest?

If what my men say is true, you are lucky not to be sharing that cell. Let us leave it at that."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then you are an optimist. If I had all that much coin to throw around I would have more recruits.
