      <ID>25</ID>
      <DefaultText>You point out a safe path along the floor, and Beodul makes his way along, sweating and stiff-jawed.

      <DefaultText>You wreak havoc upon the traps to the tune of snapping metal teeth and clattering darts.

When the cacophony is ended, Beodul peers out from between his fingers, and gives you a broad grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, if Port Maje's anything like the other Vailian ports I've been to, my advice is to do your business before you get drunk. They'll talk the boots right off you."</DefaultText>
