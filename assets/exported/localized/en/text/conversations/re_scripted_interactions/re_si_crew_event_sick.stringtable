      <DefaultText>You call on your patron, the bipartite deity of death, to turn their gaze from the ship and cleanse it of disease. A cold chill falls over the vessel, as a fog rises from the surface of the water. The wind dies.

For nigh on an hour, the ship rests in the foggy doldrums. [Specified 2] swears to hear whispers off the port bow.

Then, as quickly as it came, the fog disperses.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You order the sails furled and ration medicine to the sailors. Given both treatment and time to recover, the crew bounces back quickly. When shanties begin rising again from the deck, you know they're ready to set sail again. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sickness overtakes the ship like a sudden squall out of the northeast. At any given time it seems that half the crew has one end of their body hanging off the rails and their other in a bucket.

      <DefaultText>The crew appreciates the chance to rest, even if the constant coughing leaves them fatigued. Over the next few days, the disease runs its course. By the time the ship gets under sail again, the crew are all too willing to set forth to bluer seas.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ship sets sail, making poor time with the crew wracked by disease.

You hear a cry from the deck followed by a heavy thud. [Specified 3] went lightheaded and fell from the rigging. The hand is now concussed.

      <DefaultText>Work slows to a standstill as your crew shuffle stiffly about the decks. Spears of bone bud at their wrists and ankles. When the spears erupt through their skin, they leave red, weeping wounds in their wake.

Groans of agony find you from every corner of the ship.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] returns from the hold with a small chest containing dark black soil. "Holistic worms," the hand grunts. "They eat away the sickness causing the bone spears. It's neither pretty nor pleasant, but it'll save a life."

Each member of the crew goes to [Specified 1] in turn to have their diseased marrow entomologically excised.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pray to the Child of Light, unable to avoid remembering what brought you to the Deadfire. As you chant, the sky's color shifts to the rose-red of the early dawn. The light falls across the deck, warming those who rest in its radiance.</DefaultText>

      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>You pray to the goddess of the flame, asking her to burn the sickness from your crew. Your head begins to swim as heat takes your body. As the fever rises, you drop to the planks of the deck, vaguely aware of moans of discomfort from the rest of the crew.

It passes, however, and your thoughts clear as the cool wind of the Deadfire dries your sweat.</DefaultText>

      <ID>60</ID>
      <DefaultText>You pray to your patron, the divinity of retribution, reminding him that your crew needs strength to bring low a god. The shadows lengthen, and darkness falls over the ship. Every candle gutters.

[Specified 2] and [Specified 3] swear an unfamiliar figure stalks belowdecks, but a search reveals nothing.

Eventually the unnatural darkness passes, giving way to the natural light of the Deadfire.</DefaultText>

      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>You snap back to awareness on the forecastle, where you stand with your back to the sea. The rest of the crew glance around, expressions openly confused.

The disease is gone, but so are two days, and no member of the crew remembers what passed during them. 

You never find out.</DefaultText>

"There are cures for these ailments, you know. Or maybe you don't know. Or just don't care."

She turns her back to you.
