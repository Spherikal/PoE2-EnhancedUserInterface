      <DefaultText>An argument from the deck pulls your attention away from the gentle rocking of the ship and the smooth expanse of blue on the horizon. 

"Half of those fish were floating belly-up!" cries [Specified 0]. "Better we throw out the whole catch than end up with a rot-bellied crew!"

"They looked alive enough when we hauled them out!" [Specified 1] retorts, gesturing violently at the pile of fish on the deck. "Fish die when you pull them out of the water! That's what fish do!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Several of the fish display discolored scales and bloated bellies - clear signs of disease. It's possible their meat could sicken the crew.

"See?" [Specified 0] asks [Specified 1], scowling. "Are you trying to give us all the squatting splatters?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The wisest course, captain." [Specified 0] nods happily. 

The two hands dump the barrel overboard, returning the fish to the sea.

      <DefaultText>There are no obvious signs of disease to be found - no weeping sores or bleeding eyes - but there could be more subtle signs of piscine health that have been overlooked. 

"If we keep these fish, captain, your crew may be squatting over the bulwarks for days." 

"You worry more than my grandma, [Specified 0]. There's no sign of sickness."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There are no signs of discoloration, open sores, or bloated bellies. The fish appear perfectly healthy.

      <DefaultText>[Player Animal Companion] approaches the barrel, sniffs at the fish, and snaps one up, presenting it to you as if a gift. [Specified 1] laughs heartily.

      <DefaultText>[Player Animal Companion] sniffs at the fish, then turns up their nose at the barrel. [Specified 0] sighs.

"Seems [Player Animal Companion]'s got more between their ears than some of our fellow sailors."

"Stow it," [Specified 1] barks. "The captain's word is law. Let's get these fish below."

The pair heave the barrel and move it towards the hatch, leaving you to return aft.</DefaultText>
