      <DefaultText>"Come. Let us show him together."

The man uncorks a vial hanging from his neck filled with a viscous fluid of earthy red. He raises it and waits. 

With unsteady hands, Bearn uncorks an identical vial hanging from his own neck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bearn nearly drops the vial. He catches awkward hold of it between his forefingers.

His gaze drifts up to Edér. He stares with dull eyes, as if he's trying to place him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bearn stares down at the liquid in the vial, watching it lap against the sides with the trembling of his hand.

He draws it above his shoulders, held out before him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I will make him proud."

It sounds almost like a recitation.

Edér's mouth is open but he has no answer. He looks to you, desperation in his eyes.</DefaultText>
