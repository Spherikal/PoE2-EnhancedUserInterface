      <DefaultText>"It was not."

She turns her attention to the rattled animancer, then back to you. She calms herself before continuing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"P-p-pallegina? Is th-that you m-my girl?"

The old man's face widens into a broad smile as he holds out his arms and awkwardly gambols toward Pallegina.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina kneels down at Giacolo's approach and places her head against his chest, her arms around his thin frame. She closes her eyes and smiles as he holds her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A shadow of concern falls over the old man's face. His forehead grows thick with worried wrinkles and he gently pulls Pallegina to her feet.</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"M-my girl, what Tatzatl said is not nons-nonsense. He had good reason to be af-afraid."

He looks to you for confirmation.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. Animancy has too much dangerous potential to just let anyone research anything."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Giacolo sighs. "Sadly, many are not. And as a g-group, we have no ability to monitor and reprimand th-those who act irresponsibly."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"&lt;i&gt;Should&lt;/i&gt; animancers be limited? If so, by whom?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Tonderie! A group of pirates hardly have the authority to tell animancers how they should behave."</DefaultText>

      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina and Giacolo both turn their heads to look at you, eyebrows raised, before slowly looking at each other. It takes only a moment for them to both burst into laughter.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ac, that is funny, Watcher. Let the public decide."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I'm certain they would come up with intelligent regulations. The p-public!"

The old man laughs so hard he momentarily descends into a coughing fit.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps the ducs &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; be wise enough to regulate animancers without driving them away from the Republics."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ac, that is the danger. When Aedyr and the Dyrwood began restricting animancers, researchers simply moved east, to the Republics."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"How would that work? Would animancers submit to the authority of other animancers?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps, perhaps. Old age has a few benefits, my girl. One is a measure of respect from your younger colleagues."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If we attempted to guide them with a gentle hand... ac, perhaps."

Giacolo strokes his chin and nods.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But a light and wise hand to steady our course... perhaps that would be a good thing. Ac, perhaps."

Giacolo strokes his chin, falling deeper into thought.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>"No, they shouldn't. No one should regulate animancy."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>50</ID>
      <DefaultText>Giacolo chuckles. "I admit, it is nice to hear s-someone so su-supportive of our work, but... I think that is extreme."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"We have gone far without rules to guide us, but perhaps the time has come for a bit more s-structure."</DefaultText>

      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina considers both your words and Giacolo's in turn. She nods her head and turns her attention away. You soon realize she is lost in thought.

The moment passes quickly enough. </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, it appears we are done here. We should see you back to Neketaka, Mestre Giacolo."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I ap-appreciate all you have done, both of you." He smiles, nods, and shuffles off toward the docks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Giacolo coughs and Pallegina rolls her eyes at you. Both shake their heads and mutter to themselves in Vailian.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ac, ac. Before I g-go, I want you to have this, aimoranet. An amulet of my own invention. It resonates with g-go-godlike souls. Even severed, there is enough magic in your chime to activate its power."</DefaultText>

      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>He holds up a beautiful amulet on a slender chain. A oblong adra stone gleams in its center. As he lowers it into Pallegina's hand, he cups his other hand around hers and gently squeezes.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina smiles and nods to him before letting him go. There is sadness in her eyes, but she regains her composure quickly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>

      <DefaultText>Tears brim at the edges of Pallegina's golden eyes, her inner membranes swiftly wiping them away.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To think that Tatzatl and his crew were willing to kill for this, for the mere &lt;i&gt;possibility&lt;/i&gt; that Giacolo's research could be misused. Did they really have that much to fear?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Of course. Animancy has too much dangerous potential to just let anyone research anything."</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It does raise the question. If anyone were to restrict animancers, who would even be capable of doing so?"</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ac. I concur. I am glad that we put an end to him and his crew. I only wish that it had not cost Giacolo his life."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I suppose that says it all. Their fear dies with them... and sadly, with Giacolo."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She casts her eyes on the old man's crumpled form one last time. She can only bear it for a moment before flinching away and turning to face you.</DefaultText>
