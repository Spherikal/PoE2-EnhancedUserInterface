      <DefaultText>Loose masonry mars the southern wall of the gatehouse. Some of the protruding bricks look prominent enough to climb. 

Yet the stonework feels slick with sea spray and slime moss. You estimate a difficult climb. 

And a dangerous fall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You're halfway up when your feet slip out from under you.

Looking down, you see [SkillCheck 0] holding feebly to a jagged stone, his feet dangling over open air. 

As you watch, his hands slip from the stone, and he lands at the base of the tower with a pained yelp.

You have no choice but to climb back down after him.</DefaultText>
