      <DefaultText>You find a man dressed in worn, dirty leather armor. His long, scraggly beard is encrusted with salt, his curling hair has clearly not seen a comb in some time, and the toenails of his bare fear are cracked and torn.

The only thing of any value that he carries is an amulet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was a proud man once. A Goldpact Knight. Then I took a job, and it- it went poorly.

"I could no longer stay with the order after... &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt;." His eyes take on a faraway look as he remembers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He tells you what he learned about making - and keeping - a bargain in his years as a Goldpact Knight, showing you how to tell when a merchant knows his wares are of poor quality or overpriced.

When he's satisfied you won't get fleeced by the next back alley charm dealer you come across, he sends you on your way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The old man's eyes dart between your face and your hand where it hovers just over your weapon. His hands begin to tremble.

Though he maybe have been a knight once, he has grown frail in his old age, and he doesn't look capable of besting even a child in a fight, let alone a Watcher.</DefaultText>
