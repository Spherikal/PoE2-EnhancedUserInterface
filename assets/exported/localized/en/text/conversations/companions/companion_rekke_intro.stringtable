      <DefaultText>"Ta, yuki...Ke tagi. Lash tasam." Though he doesn't understand your words, he grasps well enough your meaning. Rekke gives you a small smile and quick nod of his head in acknowledgment, or perhaps in thanks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ke tetahibi?" He sighs deeply and shakes his head.

His long hair is tangled from his ordeal at sea. He wrings it out as best he can, then ties it back in a sloppy knot.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Kun imatak'ihe?" He cants his head to the side and narrows his eyes, as if your words are almost familiar, but he can't quite grasp their meaning.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Usuyi ikihakus!" He grits his teeth and takes a deep breath. The flash of anger passes quickly, though, and is replaced by a thin-lipped grimace of frustration.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Lash ku hakusa?" He almost shouts the words, frustration evident in the rawness of his tone.

He presses his thumbs and forefingers together and takes a deep breath. When he looks at you again, his quick flare of anger has passed, replaced by a resigned grimace.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lap pile kiku? Lakaris? Ke zilas tahun?" He knits his eyebrows. His words are unfamiliar to you, their sound low and hard-edged, but his tone is soft with confusion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Ah! Ke ked segu kiza Rekke. Reh-kah. Ta?" His eyes light up with the first expression of happiness you've seen from him. As he pronounces his name for you, he taps the center of his forehead.</DefaultText>

      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Muki kasube. Ke tahibi, ke tagi." Rekke looks at you critically, as if properly examining you for the first time.

Then, he breaks into a grin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>He stands, but barely - sodden, sun-scorched, and battered, he can hardly keep his feet. He stumbles forward a bit, then rights himself.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>He looks at you warily, bleary-eyed, exhaustion heavy on his shoulders.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>58</ID>
      <DefaultText>He turns away then, casting his gaze over the rough sea. What he's thinking is unclear, but you can guess by the vein pulsing hard in his neck and the tight fists at his sides that he seems to be coming to a decision.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>59</ID>
      <DefaultText>He sighs. "Ke lak tekatu tetatig hun, t'ekiwa ke kek tetayiteh tetaki mas shan. Ke lash tat'atay lu?"

As soon as the words leave his mouth, he grimaces, knowing that you can't understand him.</DefaultText>

      <ID>62</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ta, ta!" He pumps his fist a bit, pleased to have finally managed to communicate with you. Relief brings a bright blush to his pale cheeks.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>63</ID>
      <DefaultText>"REH-KAH." He taps the center of his forehead again, then repeats your name back to you. His green eyes flash with a keen intelligence - and frustration, too. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rekke takes a deep breath, fighting for a handle on his annoyance. Once he's got it, he gives you a sunny smile that pulls his long scar taut and shows charmingly crooked teeth.

He seems to have accepted that making himself understood will take time.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ke lash tat'atay lu?" He repeats his last sentence, this time gesturing to the length of your ship, to you, to your crew, and lastly to himself.

It would seem he wishes to travel with you.</DefaultText>
