      <DefaultText>The waters here glow an eerie blue, and the cave glistens with reflected light. 

You can just make out an opening in the cavern wall to the northwest, where the water flows onward.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You stand once more before the pool of water, and the tunnel beyond. The water laps lazily at the stone outcropping where you perch, providing a constant backdrop of sound.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You take a deep breath and slide into the cool water. You follow the cavern wall, using your hands to seek out spaces where the water does not completely fill the underground tunnel.

It takes a couple of short trips back and forth, but you find a safe place to come up for air. With a fresh lungful of air, you swim to the end of the tunnel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The tunnel bends sharply, and you follow the cavern wall, seeking out places to come up for air - and finding none. The water stings your eyes, and the featureless stone around you muddies your sense of direction. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] sets out at a good pace, cutting through the water with confident strokes.

Nearly to the far side of the tunnel, [Specified 0] finds a space to come up for air. With a place to rest along the way, the swim should be more manageable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] climbs down into the water, and sets out through the dimly-lit cavern. The cavern twists and turns, and an increasingly desperate search of the featureless stone above yields nothing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Traversing the underwater cavern becomes a matter of navigating the dim tunnels, a task made much easier now that you don't have to come up for air.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You swim forward into the unwelcoming gloom, and are immediately plunged into a confusing, watery realm of featureless stone and small, darting shapes.

You swim onward, determined, but soon it becomes clear that you have underestimated the length of the journey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You start off at a good pace, but your lungs are burning by the time you get to the second bend in the tunnel. 

Fortunately, that is the point at which you discover an air pocket. With a place to rest along the way, you're confident you can make it through the tunnel without much trouble.</DefaultText>
