      <DefaultText>"Captain?" The unfamiliar sailor chuckles, her eyes heavily hooded.

      <DefaultText>The sailors turn to you as one, eyes roving you as they size you up. One of them raises an open gloved hand, her palm towards you.

"There's no need for bloodshed. Take your mate, and we'll go our own way." She looks at [Specified 0]. "Pray you do not cross us again."

She turns on her heel and strides away, followed by the other sailors.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sailors look to one another, and one nods. She looks to [Specified 0]. "Let's hear it."

[Specified 0] gives you a sad glance, then looks back to the woman. "Sorry, ma'am."

"What was that?" The other sailors snicker.

"Sorry, ma'am!"

The woman salutes you, then turns on her heel. The sailors walk away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you round the corner, you see [Specified 0] surrounded by a group of unfamiliar soldiers. From their dress, you don't believe they're locals. They shout at [Specified 0], who returns the yelling with interest, though you can't make out the actual matter of the argument. 

One of the sailors shoves [Specified 0] against a wall, and the hand of another thug lingers dangerously near his weapon. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You let loose an arrow that buries itself deeply into a sailor's shoulder. He stumbles back, his hand covering the wound. Blood oozes between his fingers in scarlet pulses.

      <DefaultText>Your arrow sails through the group and past, lodging itself into a barrel. Several sets of eyes turn towards you. 

"That idiot tried to shoot us!" The unfamiliar sailor checks himself over as if making sure you didn't hit him with any arrows he didn't notice.

Another of the sailors straightens and points a slender finger at you. "You've signed your own death warrant!"

Her compatriots nod, drawing weapons as they approach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Silence hangs on the air for a moment as the sailors seem to consider your words.

As one they begin laughing, and [Specified 0] begins to slink away.

One of them draws her weapon and points it at you. "Let's teach the captain here a lesson."

They advance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Without saying a word, you call on the spiritual essence around you. Your muscles crack and bones pop as you grow taller. Thick fur grows carpets you, and sharp claws jut from your hands.

The sailors stare at you in abject terror, each taking hesitant steps from you. As you howl, one of them shouts and the group breaks and flees down the street.

The magic flees you, and you revert to your usual shape.</DefaultText>
