      <DefaultText>"Funny thing these Huana believe - that the whole world's inside Berath. I suppose they see one thing straight... There ain't but two kinds of people in the world - the living, and the dead."

He looks you over and sighs. "Gods alive, I do believe I'm going soft in my old age. Come on, boys. Let's leave these poor sods to their prayers."

They advance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A pair of stone eels twist up the sculpture. Each eel's mouth clings to the other's tail, creating an unbroken circuit. 

It portrays Rikuhu - the Huana's rendition of Berath.

An inscription runs along the shrine's base. "Some flee. Others fight. Rikuhu consumes all."

Finally, he sheathes his weapon. "Come on, boys. Ain't no good in getting between the gods and their chosen."

"Well then. Maybe ain't the profit in this I thought there were." He waves off the others. "Let's go boys. Leave these folks to their praying."

      <DefaultText>You kneel before the shrine and begin to pray.

You have only been at it a short time when you hear footsteps behind you. A group of Huana from the city approach the shrine. Armed and armored, they clearly make this pilgrimage prepared for bandits.

"Ekera! What are you doing here?" one of them asks you, openly scowling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn from the rubble to find a group of Huana standing behind you, their arms and armor marking them as members of the Mataru caste. Some boast narrowed eyes and hateful grimaces, but most simply bear blank, slack expressions of disbelief.

"Ekera, how dare you! That shrine always stood here for centuries!" A large aumaua shouts at you as he draws his weapon. "You'll go answer to Ngati for this! We'll feed you to her right away!"

He charges toward you as the rest draw their weapons and follow.</DefaultText>

You have only been at it a short time when you hear footsteps behind you. A group of smirking slavers have approached. Each bears arms and armor, and they look well-accustomed to hard fighting.

"Would you have a look at this, boys?" one asks, his accent marking him as Readceran. You note he wears sewn to his shirt a badge marking him as a follower of Berath. "Seems we done got ourselves a sacrifice."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Huana step back, expressions going slack as the blood drains from their faces. One, a smaller aumaua towards the rear, mutters, "Maybe we should go leave this sort be."

Only the leader of the group doesn't flinch, dark eyes meeting your own. With a final nod, the kith turns back to the other worshippers. "We can let them use this shrine. Let Ngati receive all words of praise. We will wait for them to finish."

The group goes down the path to wait. You finish your prayers, and rise feeling reinvigorated.</DefaultText>
