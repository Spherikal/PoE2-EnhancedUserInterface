      <DefaultText>You stand astride the sterncastle, gazing across the deck of [Player Ship] and out on the sea beyond, when [Specified 1] approaches. 

"There's a problem, captain. [Specified 0]'s been helping themselves to extra rations of grog on account of their injuries. The whole crew knows, and nobody's happy about it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Along with the grog, any peace you hoped to gain vanishes into the crew's revelry. They enjoy the merriment, and by the next morning, none of them remember their resentment regarding [Specified 0].

Some of them remember very little at all.</DefaultText>

[Specified 0] remains belowdecks, avoiding the others and praying for a faster recovery.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] drags the injured [Specified 0] abovedeck, securing the offender to the mast before the crew. You watch from above as [Specified 0] takes a flogging, the lash adding new injuries to old. 

A few of the crew wince and flinch through the ordeal, but once it's over, they return to their duties with quiet satisfaction.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] summons the crew to the main deck to watch as others tie a rope between [Specified 0] and the bulwark before pushing the screaming, injured sailor from the stern.

Based on the shouting, [Specified 0] manages to survive being towed behind [Player Ship] for a few hours. The rest of the crew struggle to concentrate on their duties, ashen with terror.

When the screams finally cease, [Specified 1] cuts the rope, leaving [Specified 0] to the sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You locate [Specified 0] belowdecks and demand to know why the sailor took extra grog. By way of answer, [Specified 0] unwraps the bandages from around the wound, displaying the ragged, red flesh and purpled skin. 

"It hurts worse than anything, captain. Drink's the only thing that makes it bearable."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You have [Specified 0] hauled on deck, making it clear that she'll have no more grog, and if you catch her filching again, she'll skip straight past lashes to keelhauling. By the time you finish, [Specified 0] quakes in terror, and most of the rest of the crew has paled, too.
