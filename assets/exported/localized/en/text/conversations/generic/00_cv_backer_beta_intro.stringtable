What brought you to the island?</DefaultText>

The location of the ruins is a mystery, but following the expedition's footsteps has brought you to this modest island community. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You know that the Vailians had a lead on the uncharted ruins known as Poko Kohara. 

Catching up to them won't be easy, but you've arrived at their last known location before they set out for the ruins. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You are an explorer indebted to none of the Deadfire's warring powers. You choose your loyalties as you see fit.

Even though you don't share many of the local concerns, it's never too late to start - whether for the right price or the right cause.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Vailian Trading Company is an organization of merchants and banks who ruthlessly monopolize trade in any region where they expand.

      <DefaultText>The Royal Deadfire Company is an extension of Rauatai's armada. Their goal is to expand the empire's territory before every island in the Deadfire is bought up by enterprising Vailians. Rauataian colonists put down stakes and steel themselves to tame the wild frontier on behalf of their homeland. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Huana have lived in the Deadfire for thousands of years. Tribal society is built around a caste system which dictates the division of labor and essential tenets of survival. Rauatai's original settlers emigrated from the tribes long ago, around the time that great cataclysms razed Huana settlements to the ground and decimated their once-mighty civilization.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Adra is a mineral which grows from the center of Eora. It breaches the ground in appendages not unlike standing stones. 

The function of adra is to draw wayward souls from death's waystation (the In-Between) and into the Beyond. It is a naturally-occurring vessel of soul essence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Luminous adra contains so much soul essence that it glows with ethereal, green light. 

In addition to being a useful tool for animancers, luminous adra can be mined, milled, and carefully refined into a liquid form. Applied to the skin, this substance increases vitality and delivers an overall feeling of youthfulness.</DefaultText>
