      <DefaultText>Whether single-edged or double-edged, swords are always straight-bladed one-handed weapons that can be used to cut or thrust at an enemy.

      <DefaultText>Mail armor is quite popular for its protective qualities, especially against slashing attacks. Mail is comprised of thousands of small rings of steel that form a flexible mesh.

      <DefaultText>Despite its unassuming appearance, brigandine provides impressive protection to its wearer at a cost of speed in combat.

      <DefaultText>Hide armor is commonly worn by woodsmen, Glanfathan explorers, and those who favor speed over protection. Hide armor is made of layers of soft leather.

      <DefaultText>Though the cracking binding of this grimoire suggests that it has seen much use, it appears to have been meticulously cared for. The leather cover is smooth and oiled, and not a single page is wrinkled or dog-eared.

Aloth's neat, careful calligraphy has been painted across the pages, forming an orderly catalogue of the spells he's learned and the incantations required to cast them. Arcane symbols shimmer and writhe across the pages, ready to absorb and channel energy. You feel traces of Aloth's essence within the grimoire and can almost hear him reciting his spells with measured precision.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rods are the largest of the magical implements and can be distinguished from wands and scepters by the "heads" on each end. Rods focus and release more soul energy than wands or scepters. This attribute makes their blows more powerful, but they recharge and fire more slowly.</DefaultText>

More colorful accounts claim that the drug allows one to look within themselves and witness the sight of their own soul. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A grimoire is the lifeblood of any wizard's magical repertoire. These books are painstakingly constructed with rare materials arranged in precise configurations, and are able to temporarily hold fragments of ambient soul essence, which is channeled through the book and discharged in the form of a spell.

It is a popular misconception among the uninitiated that wizards are the shapers of the magical energies they wield. In truth it is the pages of the grimoire that do the shaping. The art of wizardry is in the disciplined control and manipulation of the grimoire, with the most skilled wizards able to coax spells of maximal effectiveness and magnitude from their tomes.

Though all grimoires are limited by a finite set of pages, many accomplished wizards are known to carry several grimoires at once to handle a variety of situations.

      <DefaultText>Oidhreacht once belonged to a prominent military instructor in the capital city of Aedyr. The instructor was a cipher whose gifts were seldom used by his empire, and he grew frustrated at his superiors' inability to see the potential of ciphers to perform key missions that no other force would be capable of. He began making his opinion known, and over time the opinion became more subversive and radical, until at last his unsanctioned activities got him charged with treason.

The officer and crew that came to detain him, however, underestimated him as much as the empire had, and with only this blade and the talents of his mind, he slew his would-be captors. He fled the city and embarked on a life as a duelist, obsessed with proving his potential to any who would question it. In the end his life ended in the manner that the lives of duelists typically do, and the potential he often spoke of would remain just that.

The knife still bears his psychic imprint, and the wielder will often get flashes of the maneuvers the original owner performed in order to deliver the killing blow to his opponent. Some regard this as a curse, but many find value in it, and use such experiences to better realize the knife's potential.

Were it not for evidence of heavy use about the handle and pommel, Oidhreacht would seem new, its cutting edge perfectly beveled and honed without a single nick along its length.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The priestess who first wore these boots was a devotee of Berath and so steadfast in her faith that she eschewed the use of healing spells and potions in battle. She believed that Berath would preserve her until the end of her appointed cycle, at which point the god of life and death would take her soul's due.

Even others in the priesthood scoffed at her recklessness, and yet she was never felled in battle. The most furious onslaughts of her enemies only seemed to revitalize her, and she was a very old woman when she finally passed in her sleep.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>1504</ID>
      <DefaultText>Little could one know that the man who once destroyed part of his own country with fire would become the Dyrwood's most beloved leader. Martyred in the war he started to free his people from an oppressive rule, there isn't a Dyrwoodan who doesn't know of or revere Admeth for what he did.

Strangely, even though there are records of his father Edrang's childhood, and even though he was raised in nobility in the Dyrwood (while it was still Aedyre territory), information about Admeth's early years is nearly impossible to find. Admeth is not known for his childhood, though. He is known for saving the Dyrwood and uniting it with its sworn enemy - the Glanfathans.

In 2652 AI the Dyrwoodan troubles with the fercönyng were at a boiling point. Several of the erls under Edrang's rule, provoked by the imperial court in Aedyr, resumed looting the ruins around Dyrwood that the Glanfathans held sacred. When the Glanfathans finally retaliated, it was overwhelmingly brutal and resulted in a slave uprising. Galven Regd, whom Edrang had fought before, resumed control of the Glanfathan troops. Regd was also able to convince some delemgan to join the fight.

Edrang was, at this point, far too old to lead his forces into battle, so he sent his son Admeth in his place to contain the threat. Admeth, true to form as the son of Edrang, and obviously having learned tactics from his father, made a dangerous, but effective, tactical decision. In order to prevent Regd's troops from using the woods as cover and to keep them from advancing through his land, he set fire to the forest at tributary of the Isce Uar River and positioned his troops to prevent any of the Glanfathan forces from retreating. This tactic proved to be effective - while some Glanfathans and delemgan were able to escape, thousands died. In the skirmish that followed, Galven Regd was captured and sent to be held in New Heomar. Admeth was able to do what his father spent decades trying to do: he stopped Galven Regd.

The conflict with the Glanfathans continued for several months, and Admeth repeated the scorched earth tactic several times to flush the opposing forces from key battlefields. He was able to bring the conflict to an end before the year ended. While it was a win for the Dyrwoodans, it was very costly as well. Because of his tactics, the conflict earned the name The War of Black Trees.

After Edrang's death in 2654, Admeth became the Gréf of the Dyrwood to the dismay of the imperial court and the other erls. Over the course of the next year, they defied his rule at every turn, rebuking his decrees and countermanding his directives. 

In 2655 AI, Admeth had had enough. Even though he lacked support from most of the erls, he was admired by both the Vailian ducs and all the common folk. Backed by this support, he issued an ultimatum to the fercönyng to anoint him a gréf palatine. The fercönyng, unwilling to deal with a rebellion while trying to establish a new vorlas trade in Readceras, agreed. 

Admeth then held authority and legal power over the erls, their holdings, and their titles. The Dyrwood was no longer a gréfram, but instead was a palatinate. This change reduced the fercönyng's power over the region.

With his new power, Admeth quickly brought the rebellious erls into line. But, in exchange for the power, Admeth invested time and money into all of the Dyrwood's ports and trade posts, dramatically increasing shipping traffic. This helped the erls and brought in more money for the fercönyng.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Aedyr is a country rich with custom and they are known for their strict adherence to them. Their customs run the gamut from grand celebrations - like the Feast of Feasts - to mundane superstitions - such as ways to avoid svef addiction. This volume will focus primarily on bigger celebrations, as no one knows how to throw an extravagant party quite like an Aedyran.

The Feast of Feasts

The biggest and most important of all Aedyran customs is the Feast of Feasts. This week-long celebration happens the first week of Fonestu (Deep Summer) and is dedicated to honoring the life of the First Fercönyng. Each day of the week is devoted to some aspect of the fercönyng's life and there are very specific dishes to be served at each meal. 

The Feast of Feasts originally began as a festival celebrating the birth of the fercönyng's first son and soon became a yearly occurrence during the week of his birthday. Currently, Aedyrans simply use it as an excuse for a party and pull out all the stops in an effort to outdo the previous year.

And lest you wonder, as I did, which fercönyng is honored during The Feast of Feasts - it is always the current fercönyng. For each fercönyng is the First and Only fercönyng.

Sweet Treat

A special custom that arose at some point during The Feast of Feasts, Sweet Treat started as a way to keep children occupied so the parents could dine in peace. While it is still used for that today, significance has been added to it. Each treat is placed in a container (usually small metal boxes) and hidden somewhere on the property. After everything has been hidden, the children are sent out to find the "treasures." It is said now that the hidden treats represent Glanfathan artifacts and the children are the explorers, bringing the riches back to their new -and rightful - owners.

Carnival of the Mask

When the original colonists for Aedyr traveled to the new land to found the Dyrwood in the name of the Aedyran fercönyng, they encountered the Glanfathan people. The Carnival of the Mask celebrates this meeting. Originally, it was merely a formal reenactment - as a play - of the tensions between the Glanfathans and Aedyran settlers, but it has since evolved into much more than that. Participants choose "sides" and come dressed in elaborate outfits depicting which group they have decided to align themselves with - Aedyrans or Glanfathans. Everyone attends a masquerade ball and this party replaces any semblance of the play that was presented.

Winter's End

Winter's End was never anything more than an excuse for a celebration and it hasn't changed in all the years it has existed in Aedyr. It takes place during Winter Dusk and lasts all three days. People use the time to reflect on the year, celebrate their lives, and remember the dead - especially those who have passed in the recent year."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Animancy is a science both respected and reviled, sometimes by the same person. For all the research done on the topic, we still know so little. Control over life itself! Something animancers have been working toward for hundreds of years. There are no real records of how the practice of animancy was first discovered, but once the spark of knowledge ignited, there was no stopping its inevitable discoveries.

In 2260 AI, animancers - as a result of their extensive research - successfully contained and transferred a soul. The subject of the experiment, whose name is unknown, was young and wealthy, but infirm. The idea was to move his soul from the dying body and into that of a recently deceased man who had suffered an accident. The new body, bearing only slight decay, would house the soul - giving the man a much better life. The outcome of this experiment resulted in the condemnation and outlaw of animancy in the Aedyran Empire.

Again, while we have no true records of what happened (as they were all destroyed after animancy was outlawed) a journal was discovered, a makeshift confession by one of the participants. Excerpts from that journal follow:

2260 AI, Fonprima, 16
It is done and the gods forgive us for our arrogance. I am not sure what I was expecting - certainly not...that. But what did any of us expect?

Still, behind the revulsion there is a sense of pride - something I can't deny. All the research. The studying. Everything we worked for. We thought we'd change the world. How it’s changed!

All was in place. The twisted form lying on the table next to its new vessel. The equipment had been prepared. The tinctures and potions all carefully crafted. Every detail painstakingly organized to ensure success. We most assuredly succeeded...

The procedure went exactly as it should. The soul... extracted from the old body... held... bound in place to prevent it from moving on. Then the next step - transfer to the fresh vessel. It was beautiful and terrifying. I listened as they spoke the words of binding. I watched the soul move - not the soul itself, of course, but the vapor we use to detect it - as it lowered into the vessel. A gentle luminescence covered the body and then... nothing.

Silence. Darkness. I held my breath, afraid that even the slightest disturbance would destroy all our hard work.

Then motion. Then...dear gods...then...

Blood.

How did I survive? I do not know. The vessel rose from the slab and the room breathed. Every person crowded around the tables exhaled. Some cheered. We had made life from death. We had become eternal. The body closed its eyes and tilted its head, looking for all purposes to be listening for something - or to it. Then its eyes popped open and it moved. Its lips pealed back from its teeth in a horrible expression of fury. It fell on the nearest man, tearing his throat, knocking him to the ground. Then the room erupted into screams, shouts, and a flurry of bodies running, pushing, doing everything in their power to get away from the creature sitting on their colleague.

But right before that happened, in the split second before the chaos, when there was nothing in the air but a stunned, terrified silence, I heard it. Sitting there on his chest, face at his neck.

And it was feasting.

Fear not the journey when the portal opens.
Become one with the Wheel with glad heart and cheerful countenance.
For the doorway shall open for all in their time.
Neither the rich nor influential, neither kings nor rulers, neither the strong nor powerful can escape its embrace.
Berath will usher thee through the doorway and thou willst return to life, thy mortal life begun anew.
There goest the cycle. There goest life. There thou goest also.
 
Thou shalt approach the door, the inevitable shall approach thee.
Do not turn back on the portal, do not turn back on new life.
Walk the path and welcome change or face the knight
For he walks the road with thee and will guide all to their destination.

Thou mortal, the skull thou wilt become.
Thou closed off, the key thou shalt turn.
Thou sealed, the threshold thou shalt cross."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Mention the name Pandgram to anyone with even a passing knowledge of animancy and you could find yourself in for a very long discussion. Publicly reviled but privately lauded as a hero and genius, Pandgram's history is at turns revolutionary, horrific, and mysterious. 

Pandgram was fascinated - some might say obsessed - with the concept of animancy. It consumed his life as he dedicated everything to understand it. He would frequently travel to Eir Glanfath and the Dyrwood to visit the Engwithan ruins. There he would take notes and make sketches, bringing anything back with him that he could to help him unlock the mysteries. After years of study, Pandgram had reached the point where he could no longer conduct research on his own, and he took on an assistant - Helig of Thein. Soon, Helig was making trips to Eir Glanfath in Pandgram's stead, gathering knowledge while Pandgram stayed behind to experiment. This partnership quickly bore fruit and Pandgram made a breakthrough - one that would irrevocably change his life and the general attitude about animancy forever.

While the specifics of his experimentation will never truly be known, the rumors and stories that still circulate tell that he had sent out inquiries, asking for live subjects for help with a dangerous experiment that might change their life - or might end it. Those who were already dying were especially encouraged to apply. Response was overwhelming and Pandgram had his pick of numerous willing bodies. That is when he had his breakthrough. He discovered a way to fix a soul, anchoring it to its body so it couldn't leave at death.

He had discovered eternal life.

His research and life's work had resulted in the greatest single discovery that animancy could hope for. His findings were published and quickly spread through Vailia - and beyond. While some groups - the Woedican church, for example - decried his work as nothing more than blasphemy and heresy, many put it to practice. Everyone wanted the chance at immortality.

But everything comes with a cost. It quickly became apparent that simply restraining the soul, while keeping the person technically "alive," was doing nothing for the body, which continued to decay - devolving and warping the soul now trapped inside it. The creatures it created were dangerous - carnivorous beasts that killed brutally and indiscriminately. The backlash was ruthless. The practice of Pandgram's discoveries was outlawed. His works were collected and burned. He and Helig were branded heretics and hunted, chased from town to town until Pandgram simply vanished.

Helig was tracked down, captured, and brought to trial for the atrocities committed against Vailia and its people. The trial was barely more than a formality to bring charges against him as everyone knew what hand he had played in the disaster. He was sent to prison for years, but eventually released once public outrage died down. Not long after his parole, he disappeared as well.

Occasionally, talk surfaces that a copy of Pandgram's theorems has been found, untouched by the purging flames that destroyed its brothers. These rumors seldom end up being more than that. Many groups and wealthy individuals have formed sending out a call to anyone who will listen - find us a copy of the theorems. They offer gold, jewels, status, anything they can to entice adventurers to help them achieve their goals. For there are those who would give anything a chance at immortality - even become a monster."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The origins and practices of Dunryd Row are difficult to nail down. When asked, everyone seems to know how Dunryd Row started and how long it’s been in operation. Yet every person asked gives a different account of its creation and a different date. The only thing everyone can agree on is that it seems to have been around as long as anyone can remember. Without fail, everyone recalls hearing about the exploits of Dunryd Row when they were children.

Aside from the organization being comprised of special investigators (most of whom seem to be ciphers) and the fact that they seem to have their hands in everything (yet never admit to it), anything reported about Dunryd Row walks the line between truth and outright hearsay. Information abounds, but no one can say which fragments are truth and which are fiction. I will provide all I have uncovered and leave it to the readers to decide for themselves, as all of it feels both plausible and unbelievable at turns.

The group is supposedly named after the street where its headquarters are located, in a building called Hadret House. It is said in some circles this is just the name they want people to think they're known by. Their real headquarters, people whisper, is elsewhere. Why would they do this? It's simple - it's far easier for them to infiltrate, to hide, to carry on behind the scenes if everyone is concentrating on ‘Dunryd Row.’ Divert attention where you want people to look and you can act behind their backs with impunity. 

People who have had interactions with agents from Dunryd Row invariably describe them as ‘unmemorable.’ No detail as to their appearance, behavior, or anything - beyond the fact that they were there - seems to stick with anyone. Are they truly nondescript? Or do their ciphers use their powers to remain anonymous? As with so many questions regarding Dunryd Row, no one seems to know. While no specific details about the agents are ever reported, one "fact" that all people agree with is that they seem primarily to be orlans and Glanfathan elves, though theories as to why this may be are many and conflicting.

Their presumed headquarters is supposedly run by Lady Eydis Webb. Though no one seems able to pinpoint the time of her arrival, the author was unable to locate a single person familiar with Dunryd Row who could remember a time when she wasn't around. Many things are hinted at behind closed doors about Lady Webb, but few are willing to elaborate, for it is rumored that although she has not left Hadret House since anyone can remember, she is a cipher of tremendous power, and that she can read the thoughts of the entire city at will. Theories abound regarding her age, her reasons for what would seem to be a lifetime of seclusion, and even of her secret control over all of Defiance Bay, if not Dyrwood itself. But as with all other matters regarding the organization, no one seems to be able to say anything for sure. "

      <DefaultText>Characters, in order of appearance
Belmis, the Doughty Burglar
Torfal, the man of the house
Clanna, the lady of the house
Pafenda, the maid
Ireby, an important visitor

Setting: Interior. The sitting room of Torfal's house. Night.
The stage is dark. The door to the room opens and Belmis enters, holding a candle. He walks slowly through the room, picking up items, examining them, and replacing them. Presently, there is a noise off-stage. Belmis freezes and listens.

TORFAL (offstage): Enough of this nonsense! I told you we would be returning early!
CLANNA (offstage): You said early! You didn't say we would be inexcusably rude!

The voices are approaching the door to the sitting room. Belmis extinguishes that candle and hides behind chair at the end of the stage opposite the door. The door opens.

TORFAL (entering, followed by Clanna and Pafenda, voice even and controlled): This meeting is very important, Clanna, my little cowslip. Ireby is taking this meeting himself. This is unheard of!
CLANNA: But, Torfal-
TORFAL: Not another word!

Belmis' head appears over the chair during this exchange. He watches the three interact. When Clanna talks, he is entranced by her.

TORFAL: Pafenda, have all the preparations been made for Ireby's arrival?
PAFENDA: Yes, sir. The special brandy has been brought from the cellar. And the... other refreshment has been prepared as well.
CLANNA: Other... Torfal! Don't you dare!
TORFAL: If that's what it takes, Clanna, that's what I'll do. Now, go prepare yourself for Ireby's arrival. We must all look our best. This contract must not fail!

All three leave the room. Belmis stands.

BELMIS: Who was that vision? Who was that goddess? Who was it that has stolen my heart just as surely as I would steal hers? I must know her. I must meet her. I must have her! But how?</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Edrang Hadret in retrospect led a remarkable life. But his contributions would probably have gone largely unnoticed if it weren't for his conflict with a Glanfathan orlan by the name of Galven Regd.

Though Edrang became a great man and a well-respected leader, his early life was uneventful. He was born in Aedyr of noble parents and spent a good part of his childhood there. While he was raised apart from the common folk, he felt a connection to them and was known to always be welcoming to any and all.

In school, he demonstrated incredible intelligence, frequently arriving at correct conclusions using his own methods of getting there. He was always doing unexpected things and though he seemed to be paying attention and would pass his lessons, his teachers and trainers were certain he would never amount to anything.

His family moved to the Dyrwood as colonists while he was still a teen. The moment they docked in the new land, Edrang knew he had found his true home. He explored the land, getting to know it and its people as well as he knew the castle in which he lived. He grew into a man who was well-respected by all who met him. He took over the erldom, becoming a fair and much beloved leader. Under his leadership, Baelreach thrived, becoming more stable and prosperous than anyone thought possible. When a new gréf was needed, the people's voice was unanimous - Edrang Hadret.

As his first act as the new gréf, the fercönyng instructs Edrang to build a new city for him, a seat of power in the Pearlwood Gulf. This city is to be called New Dunryd and will serve as the capital for the new colonies. Not long after he assumed power, The Broken Stone War began. It was a quick and brutal war and taxed the limits of Edrang's capabilities. He had never before encountered someone as organized and brutal as the opposition commander, Galven Regd. At first Regd's tactics confounded Edrang. But Edrang, who grew up developing unorthodox ways to take care of his problems, adapted quickly.

This did not stop Galven Regd outright, however. He began a campaign of terror that lasted for two more years. Edrang, who expressed a sort of respect for Regd's prowess, studied his techniques, learning how Regd attacked and devising a ways to counter it. He gave the erls and thayns instructions that confounded and sometimes infuriated them as they seemed to leave their lands open for attack and put their people at risk. Edrang disseminated lies and half-truths about his plans, imperial events, and military maneuvers. No one knew what truly was going on except for Edrang and a very small contingent of trusted friends and advisers. His tactics worked and Edrang's men started to catch the Glanfathans off guard.

It wasn't long before Edrang's men were able to anticipate Regd's moves and cut him off at every front. When asked how he was able to overcome an enemy that anticipated every move, Edrang responded, ‘That is how he was about to outwit us. Our moves were transparent. Anyone could see through the standard tactic. Spread something out thin enough and you can poke a hole in it. I countered an unpredictable enemy with unpredictability.’

Because Edrang was able to counter Regd's plans, the conflict eventually died off. Regd sent a message to Edrang, expressing respect for his tactics and prowess with military maneuvers. This political and military stalemate led to the first treaties signed between the Glanfathans and the Aedyran colonist who would eventually become the Dyrwoodans."

      <DefaultText>"The history of Eir Glanfath before it was discovered by Aedyran explorers is poorly documented and oral accounts often conflict. Some tell stories of an advanced civilization that left, taking all its knowledge with it, leaving ruins of their civilization behind. Others say the Glanfathans themselves developed such power and technology that they all but destroyed themselves and that is why they will not allow anyone into the ruins on their land. Either way, reliable information about the area of Eir Glanfath doesn't begin until Aedyran explorers discovered it in 2602 AI.
 
The Glanfathans were not used to encounters with outsiders before and viewed the intrusion on their land as something of a test. The ruins that covered their land were considered sacred and these strangers, despite warnings, plundered them, taking artifacts. Glanfathans that resisted were captured and forced into slavery, becoming property of the new colonists. Their people, heritage, and land at stake, the Glanfathans struck back, hoping to drive them out of their lands permanently. Despite their best efforts, more Aedyran invaders appeared. By 2623 AI, the Aedyrans had established towns, pushing the Glanfathans out of some areas and enslaving any who refused to leave. They tried to live in peace, keeping an eye on the Aedyrans, and with the exception of a few isolated incidents, it seemed to work. This tentative peace came to a bloody end in 2626 AI. A group of farmers, clearing a potential crop field in the middle of an area dotted with many sacred ruins, knocked down one of the ancient menhirs. Whether this was intentional or accidental is not known, but this incident started what came to be known as the Broken Stone War. It was short, lasting less than a year, but it was bloody and brutal. Several thousand Aedyran colonists died as well as hundreds of Glanfathans.

Though the war ended, the attacks on the Aedyrans didn't stop. An orlan named Regd was chosen as galven of the Glanfathans. He vowed to make every outsider pay for the injustices done on his people's land. He organized the Glanfathan Fangs and orchestrated a series of attacks over the course of the next two years. It seemed Regd's tactics would eventually work and drive the Aedyrans from Eir Glanfath, but then they started fighting back. They became far more organized and their tactics less predictable. Fewer and fewer of Regd's attacks succeeded. He discovered a new gréf, Edrang Hadret, had been appointed - someone whose tactics and battle savvy were more evenly matched with his. Eventually both leaders came to a stalemate, neither able to gain the upper hand on the other.

As a result of the stalemate, the hostilities between the two groups dwindled as there was never a significant result for either side. This led to treaties, developed and signed by both, to eliminate the violence and tension. Regd stepped down as galven and returned to his life. Hadret set a decree - looting the ruins of Eir Glanfath is an arrestable offense. As a sign of goodwill, Hadret also tried to outlaw slavery, but this act was struck down by the other erls and the fercönyng of Aedyr. Because of this, some incidents of rural violence still cropped up. Hadret's treaties resulted in 20 years of relative peace for the Glanfathans, still wary and distrustful of the Aedyrans, but willing to accept their presence if they had to."

      <DefaultText>"The Ethik Nôl is a group both fascinating and dangerous. An ancient druidic order, its beliefs fall well outside what the average person might imagine of druids. 

Though details are sketchy, the Ethik Nôl would seem to have originated in the White March, as the order itself consists mostly of dwarves. The traditional druidic chants of the Ethik Nôl speak of the people as a ‘collective whole’ that ‘created a necessary balance’ through their ‘strict adherence to the purity’ of their line. This has been interpreted by historical chroniclers to mean that there was a time when only dwarves were allowed to be Ethik Nôl.

Residing now in Twin Elms, records of the Ethik Nôl date back to well before the settlement had arrived at its present name, and in fact, some information places them in Twin Elms even before the Glanfathans arrived. If this is truly the case, the Ethik Nôl are one of the oldest druidic orders in existence.

Their beliefs don't conform to what is normally viewed as a ‘druidic viewpoint.’ Sacrifice, blood, fire, and an intense drive for balance in all things (well beyond most druidic standards) pervade their rituals. Core to this is the dogma that if you want something from the universe, you must also sacrifice something into the universe to maintain the balance. Nothing can ever be received without something first being given. If you perform the sacrifice, your desires will always be satiated. The simplest example of the sacrificial balance as explained to the author went as thus:

‘Say you are one of these Ethik Nôl. And say you want your daughter's marriage to go well. You don't want problems. So you ask of the elders what you must do. You are told what the appropriate sacrifice is, and then you perform it. In this case, it could be as simple as throwing some coins into lava, giving the metal back to the earth. Sacrificing something that is important to you, right? But the requirement is always different and you don't know what is expected of you until you're asked. The more significant request, the more significant the demand. And most things of true value must be paid in blood.’

I was told of people removing fingers, toes, even whole limbs. One farmer was reputed to have sacrificed his youngest son.

Another good question many people have raised is in regards to the Glanfathans. Why do they allow such a potentially violent, possibly dangerous group to live in Eir Glanfath? Why not force them out? Rumors are that the Ethik Nôl are able to make from an ancient recipe a unique war paint, apparently blood-based, and they are the only people in the world who can. The Glanfathans, it is said, have come to believe this war paint provides tremendous advantage in combat, and the residence of the Ethik Nôl in Twin Elms is predicated on the fair trade of the substance."

      <DefaultText>"Mention the name Regd in Eir Glanfath and you'll be told stories of a glorious freedom fighter - an orlan who used his tactical savvy and battle training to protect the Glanfathan from the encroaching evil of the invaders in the Dyrwood. Ask someone in the Dyrwood about him and you'll hear angry retellings of the exploits of an underhanded, dirty-fighting orlan who terrorized Dyrwoodan citizens. This conflict is what legends are built on and Galven Regd is the stuff of legends.

The Broken Stone War began from a misunderstanding between the Glanfathans who lived in the Dyrwood and the Aedyran colonists who were moving in. Tensions were already high between the two groups as the Aedyrans claimed land the Glanfathans said they already owned. Add to it the Glanfathans taken and forced into slavery by the Aedyrans and it was only a matter of time before something snapped and sent the two groups to war. There was the occasional skirmish or fight between isolated groups, but no real conflict until The Broken Stone War.

Whether intentional or not, Aedyran farmers, clearing land for their crops, knocked over and destroyed one of the ancient menhirs that dot the countryside. The Glanfathans, who revered the ancient structures in the Dyrwood, reacted swiftly and violently led by a particularly fanatical Fang by the name of Regd. While the war was short-lived and the Glanfathans were ultimately not the victors, Regd and his forces were able to eliminate a significant number of colonists.

After the war ended, Regd was appointed the Galven, or leader, of the Glanfathan tribes. His leadership skills and prowess in battle earned him the respect of all the tribes of Eir Glanfath. Because all the tribes were unified behind him, he was able to move and coordinate their warriors in a way that organized them into such an efficient team, the Aedyran colonists lived in fear of his next attack. His name and reputation spread through both lands. Over two years following The Broken Stone War, Regd and his forces, using deception, misinformation, and straightforward guerrilla tactics killed hundreds. The remaining erls send word to the fercönyng, saying something must be done before more nobility is killed, but Regd continues to terrorize the colonists and it seems the campaign will never end.

That is, until he encountered Edrang Hadret."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Glanfathan customs can seem primitive and unsophisticated to some. But all customs begin with a ritual or superstition, so why should theirs be considered less than any other? If they are examined closely, Glanfathan celebrations stem from a deep and rich culture and all tie in to their history in a significant way.

The Festival of the Ancients

The Festival of the Ancients takes place during Spring Dawn and is a time to celebrate the Glanfathans settling in Eir Glanfath. It is a simple, three-day ceremony that is mostly centered on feasts. These feasts are set up around the ruins scattered through Eir Glanfath. Wreaths made from tree branches and flowers are placed at the ruins and prayers are said to the gods, thanking them for health and prosperity.

The Cleansing

The Cleansing started as a protest, recreating the hardships wrought upon the Glanfathans by the Aedyran colonists when they started settling the Dyrwood. It has morphed over the years and is now used more as a game mixed with a teaching tool to inform your Glanfathans about the history of their people. The Cleansing takes place on New Year and Mid Year and now acts as a metaphor for real events instead of a recreation of the events themselves. Xaurip effigies are placed throughout the forest, hollow clay shells filled with sweets and gifts. The children then search the woods for the effigies and destroy them, "cleansing" the forest so they Glanfathans can move in and occupy the areas. After the area has been cleared, they gather for a celebration and feast where the elders tell the young members the true story of their people's history.

Holiday of the Black Tree

A combination of a day of remembrance and celebratory feast, the Holiday of the Black Tree is held on the second day of Autumn Falling when the trees are still colorful but losing their leaves and the land is becoming cold and dark. Glanfathans use the day to tell the story of the War of the Black Trees and remember those who were lost. During the morning, the adults hang elaborate garlands from the tree branches. The garlands are made from red, orange, and yellow flowers and represent the flames that swept through the forests of Eir Glanfath, destroying everything in their paths. After a morning of fasting and reflection, the children are set to run through the trees, tearing down the garlands and bring them back to the feast, decorating the tables with wildflowers, turning the horror of war into something beautiful. Then they eat, cheering the peace they now have with the Dyrwoodan people and toast to many more years of peace to come.

Also of note in Glanfathan culture is their abundance of traveling customs. Being a semi-nomadic people, they practice customs to ensure their safety while on the move.

Traveling Customs

If you are taking a quick trip, purchase a gift for someone you are visiting and leave it at your home. If something important is left undone (such as giving a gift to a loved one), you will always return to finish the task.

If you are taking a longer trip, leave remembrances of your trip - no matter how well you know the road. Drop some pebbles along the way or tie ribbon to the tree branches. Mark your path away and you'll always have a safe and easy trip back.

Evil spirits and dangerous creatures are everywhere in our world. If you decorate your cart with masks, they will scare away any danger that might otherwise approach. But you must decorate your cart anew every trip or the evil won't be fooled by your ruse!"

      <DefaultText>"What can be said about House Doemenel that isn't whispered fearfully in a back room over the dim light of a dying fire in fear that the wrong set of ears will hear it? The Doemenel history is colorful and violent, exciting and more than a little bloody.

The Doemenels were a small Aedyran family that dealt almost exclusively in textiles. They made a modest living, slowly gaining a reputation for having high-quality product. This reputation earned them connections - business, social, and sometimes marital - that solidified their position as the premiere family of the region. If you wanted access to anyone, the Doemenels were the way to do it.

Soon, every city had a business that was owned, at least in part, by the Doemenels. Their power and influence grew until many said the family had more power than even the fercönyng of Aedyr.

But with the power came the corruption. One cannot have that level of control and expect to keep it through strictly legal means. Soon, rumors were spreading of threats, and extortion. Though it cannot be proven, the unofficial report is that the Doemenels were responsible for the death of Trindig Byrnwigr which left his entire shipping empire in the hands of his wife, Udele Doemenel Byrnwigr.

With their hold on the land practically secured, the Doemenels no longer stuck to the shadows, brazenly eliminating opponents, manipulating deals, and threatening anyone who might cause them a problem. Because they now dominated the trade route, no one dared oppose them anymore for fear their business would be strangled.

Like most empires, though, not even theirs could last forever. The end came during the War of Defiance. Unlike most of the land, the Doemenels threw in with Aedyr instead of Admeth Hadret. After the defeat of the empire and the destruction wrought on the land during the war, not even the Doemenels could rebuild what they had. And, having history show them on the wrong side of the war, no one would touch the name. The domain that took years to build crumbled in mere months.

Today, the Doemenels have once again built a name for themselves, proving they are still capable and savvy businesspeople. Rumors about the family still circulate, though. Word is members of the family are striving to lift the family from its current obscurity and elevate it to the level of power it once held."

      <DefaultText>"In recent years, the Knights of the Crucible has evolved as a group. No longer concentrating solely on blacksmithing or combat training, they've adjusted their focus to help initiates develop their souls as well as their bodies. From initiation there is a well-defined path to the top of the order.

Squire

When a candidate shows sufficient prowess in blacksmithing (or, recently, at least the drive and potential), he is accepted into the order as a Squire. Once he is part of the order, training begins immediately. Lessons are divided into two main sections - Body, commanded by the Lord Marshal and Soul, overseen by the Grand Crucilar. At this point in their progression the only uniform the squire is allowed is a simple cloth uniform displaying the Knights’ colors.

Novitiate

After sufficient training, each Squire is given a three-part test. He must repair a broken piece of armor, he must recite the Canticles of Abydon from memory, and he must be able to land a blow on a Novitiate in combat. If he succeeds at all three of these tasks, he is promoted to the position of Novitiate. At this point he is given his first official piece of Crucible armor - a brigandine. His training now doubles, as only the most valiant of candidates makes it through to the next level.

Justiciar and Templus

When a Novitiate shows he is ready (decided by his teachers and trainers), he must make a decision. His training and advancement from this point on will focus on one of the two disciplines: Body or Soul. Novitiates that choose Body continue military training as a Justiciar under the Lord Marshal. Novitiates that choose Soul are given clerical training as a Templus under the Grand Crucilar. Justiciar or Templus, the newly appointed is taken through the Ritual of the Arm. He is given his plate armor and symbol of Abydon. He is then taken to the Smith's Forge (named after Abydon) and is tasked with forging a small nail out of iron. He affixes this nail to his armor under Abydon's symbol and will wear it there for the rest of his life as a Knight of the Crucible. At this point, the Knight's training is fixed. If he chose Body, that is the path he is on until the end of his days. If he chose Soul, there is no deviating from the course. That is why the choice is only presented after he has been through many months of training."</DefaultText>

Travel between the two oceans is virtually impossible. Great storms hammer any ships foolhardy enough to attempt to navigate, and this alone should be enough to deter anyone from attempting the voyage as untold ships have gone down, tossed against the rocks.

The weather and treacherous rocks are only a precursor to the actual horror of the archipelago, the terrors of the deep. No one knows how many creatures stalk the oceans, waiting for unsuspecting sailors to drift into their waters. But we do know of some.


Barbed Ravager

A giant shark that is known to ram passing vessels, trying to knock sailors off the deck and smash a hole in the hull. It has tremendous spines protruding from its side and back that are presumed to be poisonous. The largest sighted Barbed Ravager (with survivors) was estimated to be almost 30 feet long.


Winding Serpent

Smaller around than the Ravager, but potentially longer, the Winding Serpent attacks in small packs, usually 3-8. They have long, sharp heads, somewhat reminiscent of a barracuda. 

Like the Ravager, they repeatedly slam into the side of a ship hoping to crack a hole in it or knock someone from the deck. They have also been known to swim to the depths and shoot up out of the ocean, landing on the deck, coiling and winding their way around, snapping up any crew they can before plunging back into the ocean.


Leviathan

Imagine the largest whale you have ever seen. The leviathan is at least ten times that size. By the time a ship sees a leviathan, it is already too late. As they rise from the depths, the water around them begins to spin and sink, creating a whirlpool. 

The leviathan's body surrounds the hapless vessel, preventing escape, and as it goes down, the enormous mouth opens, pulling all aboard to their watery deaths.


Polpovir

All the creatures you've read about in this book are nothing compared to the Polpovir. Barely the size of a man, what they lack in size and strength, they make up for in numbers and terrifying viciousness. 

Their lower halves are a mass of tentacles like an octopus or squid, but more numerous. The tentacles are long, black whips with suction cups on the underside and small thorny barbs on the top. The sheer number of tentacles gives them frightening speed when walking on land, pulling themselves forward almost as fast as a running horse. 

While they vaguely resemble a human from the waist up, any extended examination proves how wrong that assumption is. Long, stringy black hair falls from the top of their heads to cover a face taken directly from a nightmare. A wide, gaping mouth, cuts across the bottom of its head from ear to ear, full of wicked dagger-like teeth. Two large round eyes are sunken into its head, black as coal, shining with a malevolent fire. A small antenna protrudes from the middle of its forehead, ending in a small nodule that can glow with an eerie blue light.

One can imagine a sailor on the deck of his ship at night, looking out across the black water, blood freezing as countless lights appear beneath the surface, rising toward him as the Polpovir swarm upward. 

Because they seem to be more octopus than man, they can collapse in on themselves, fitting into spaces no person should be able to. The smallest crack in a hull, the slightest separation between boards offers them entrance. It is not unknown for them to slaughter an entire crew from hold up to deck by infiltrating the ship from underneath. 

Fortunately they do not seem to have spread too far outside of the archipelago, but there may come a day when Polpovir attacks become commonplace."

I move.
There is no compulsion. It is not a need.
But something pulls.
I cannot deny its draw.

The white wends out past my vision.
Its fierce eyes watch me as I move.
The wolf tracks my step.
A silent companion who will not join.

All is blank. The pale expanse lies before and behind.

I search.
The miles pass and still my feet move.
My hunt continues unabated.
The landscape returns my gaze, unaffected by my presence.

The snow falls, needles driven by the wind.
Its cold teeth bite my skin.
The snow gathers, its hands around my feet,
A fierce opponent who will not relent.

All is white. My journey continues.

I travel.
I can no longer stop. A true compulsion forms.
The need drives me on.
I must see.

The sun breaks through the gray.
Its unrelenting gaze thaws me.
My body warms under its touch,
Frigid limbs move again and carry me farther.

All is empty. The breadth of existence is my destination."</DefaultText>

Man
Male, a Ghostly Being
Female, a Ghostly Being
Beggar
Starving Man
Injured Man

Setting: Empty field. No trees or buildings in sight.

A man lies on the ground center stage. He wakes slowly and looks around. Two Ghostly Beings approach him, a male from the stage left, a female from stage right.

MAN: Where am I? What has happened?
MALE: Nothing has happened.
MAN: How did I get here?
FEMALE: You did not arrive. You are just here.
MAN: What is going on?
MALE &amp; FEMALE: You are traveling. We will travel with you.

They both reach out a hand to him, insistently. He looks at them, not sure what to do. After a few moments of deliberation, he takes Male's hand and allows him to help.

MALE (aside, to Female): His soul is strong. This decision will be easy.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Such arrogance surely will be your undoing.

They walk to the end of the stage and encounter a Beggar, holding out a bowl.

BEGGAR: Will you help the needy? Will you hear the call of charity? What will you do for those less fortunate?
MALE: Here is a beggar. What will you do? He has no food, no clothes. He is destitute and will surely die if no mercy is shown him.
FEMALE: Surely he deserves no mercy. Look to his legs - do they not move? Look to his arms - can they not work? Look to his eyes - can they not see? Surely he can provide for himself?

MALE &amp; FEMALE: What will you do?

The man ponders for a moment, then reaches into his pocket and drops a coin in the Beggar's bowl.

BEGGAR: Thank you, kind sir. May your charity come back to you in turn!

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Why did you give alms to this beggar?

MAN: I saw a man in need. It is not for me to say if he deserves mercy, only that I need provide mercy if I am able. I have the means to help, so I help. If he has the ability to provide for himself and does not, that is on his head, not mine. If I can provide the light of dawn to a man in need, it is my duty to do so.

MALE (aside, to Female): He knows Charity, even disguised as a beggar. His mind is open.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Even those with an open mind can be closed down.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Let us continue our journey.

They walk to the other edge of the stage, leaving the Beggar behind. They approach the Starving Man, who puts out his hands in supplication

STARVING MAN: A crust? A morsel? Please? Surely generosity will not allow you to stand by and let someone starve!
MALE: This man is starving. What will you do? He is on the brink of death. Only an act of generosity will save him.
FEMALE: What need has this man that he cannot provide for himself? Why should you turn over that which you earned to one who has done no such act and who deserves nothing from you?

MALE &amp; FEMALE: What will you do?

Again, the man considers what he will do. He reaches into his pocket and retrieves a piece of bread and gives it to the Starving Man.

STARVING MAN: Thank you! Thank you, good sir! May your generosity be returned unto you tenfold!

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Why did you give food to the hungry?

MAN: I saw a man who hungered. It is not for me to say if he deserves a morsel, only that I need provide a morsel if I am able. I have the food to spare, so I give. If I can open a man's eyes to the light, it is my duty to do so.

MALE (aside, to Female): He knows Generosity, even disguised as a starving man. His heart is giving.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Even those with a giving heart can be greedy.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: We will continue our journey."

      <DefaultText>"With the mention of the name Waidwen, most folk think only one word - Godhammer. While this event echoes through the ages and is still felt years after the destruction of Evon Dewr Bridge, Waidwen's humble beginnings belie the powerful force he would grow into.

Waidwen lived an unassuming life in a remote area of Readceras, the son of vorlas farmers. He toiled in the fields alongside his father for 22 years, until his father's death. The farm then fell to him to run. He considered selling, but had no other skills upon which to draw, so he set on the path of vorlas farmer as well. Nothing of note has been recorded in Waidwen's life until 4 years after his father's death. One day, while working the fields, Waidwen's life was irrevocably changed. In his words:

‘Night was falling, the fingers of dusk already gripping the sky. The sun had dipped behind the world's edge and stars were peeking from beyond the Shroud. The day was still and darkness had blanketed the field. I placed my last harvest of the day into the collection pile when from behind me arose a brilliant light. I turned, fear in my breast, knowing not what could have caused such intense radiance.

Behind me stood a blazing figure, resplendent in glory. Its white flesh glowed with a luminescent radiance, its head a blinding ball of light, brighter than the highest sun of Mid Year. I averted my gaze, afraid I would be struck down for daring to gaze upon such a creature.

A sudden peace washed over me, sweeping away my fear, leaving my troubled soul tranquil. A loving warmth wrapped its arms around me. A voice spoke to me as I stood, transfixed, trying to both see this glorious being and avoid its dazzling scrutiny.

"Fear not," it said to me, "for you are chosen above all others. You will be the light to bring about the rebirth of an empire." It then held out its hand and bestowed upon me a vision of power, such that I could scarcely contain it.’

Waidwen, disheveled and dirty, stumbled into his village the next morning, telling all who would listen about the miracle that happened in his fields. Eothas himself, he claimed, had appeared to him. He was to punish the Aedyran governor for leading his people into ruin. A way would be provided and those faithful who helped would be blessed when ‘the divinity manifested.’ Villagers ignored him, convinced the loss of his parents had broken his mind.

But Waidwen continued to preach of the power of Eothas and the corruption of the governor, eventually earning him the ire of the locals. His confrontations with the villagers hit a turning point one day in Mid Autumn. A crowd had gathered around Waidwen, jeering him and telling him to leave the village. The vorlas crop that season was particularly light and the villagers blamed Waidwen, saying he had angered the gods, particularly Eothas, with his blasphemy. They backed him into one of the withered fields, yelling at him to go. Accounts of the inciting action are hazy. Some say a stone was thrown, others say he was pushed, other still say he simply tripped over a dry root sticking from the ground. Regardless of the cause, Waidwen landed, face down, on the ground, the villagers standing over him, laughing.

‘Enough!’ a voice, not Waidwen's, boomed across the field. Waidwen looked up at the crowd, his eyes glowing with a blinding white light. He stood, but did not stand. One moment he was on the ground and the next he was standing before the crowd, who cowered before him.

‘You dare deny me?’ the voice spoke through Waidwen's mouth. ‘You dare refuse my servant?’ Waidwen's arms raised, beginning to luminesce. 'You dare require proof?' His arms went out to his sides. ‘Never ask again, lest you be burned in the light of the new dawn!’ There was a flash of light from Waidwen's eyes and hands and the entire field sprang to life. The once dried and brittle plants became full, lush, and verdant.

The crowd was silent. From somewhere in the back came a call of ‘Praise Eothas!’ and then they all fell to their knees in front of Waidwen, farmer-turned-god."

      <DefaultText>"In approximately 2200 AI, a group of tribes called The People of the Deer unified into a new civilization called the Aedyr Kingdom. The tribes, small and widespread over the land, knew it would be better for their continued existence to unify. The leaders of each tribe became advisers to the king, chosen by the group. Each advisor would still be lord over his people, but each lord would answer to the fercönyng (FAYR-cö-ning, "first king"). This decision turned out to be exactly what was needed and the Aedyran Kingdom thrived, spreading out over the land, establishing strong trade routes, and became known to be fair - but shrewd - businessmen. While the country thrived and internally there was little strife, there were still the occasional skirmishes with the neighboring elven kingdom of Kulklin.

Not long after the kingdom was formed, the Aedyran people began studying animancy. Still largely unknown at that time, it was an exciting, terrifying new realm that Aedyran scholars saw great potential in. This potential came to bear fruit in 2260 AI, when a group of animancers - working together - transferred the soul of a recently departed man into another body, creating the first of what would later come to be known as the "undead." The reaction to this discovery was swift and decisive. Both the king of Aedyr and the church of Woedica condemned this event and the study or practice of animancy was outlawed. It would never again be practiced openly on Aedyran soil.

Conflicts with Kulklin continued, escalating into a minor war in 2398 AI. Afterward, a treaty was signed and the Kingdom of Aedyr merged with Kulklin to form the Aedyr Empire. With the political and military strife now settled, the Aedyr Empire would become an economic powerhouse. Able to provide resources that were hard to find in other parts of the world, their trade routes became some of the most lucrative in the world."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"‘If the blacksmith fails, the armor fails. If the armor fails, the soldier falls.’ - Olrun Cyneheod, first guild master of the Knights of the Crucible.

The Knights of the Crucible have one of the most fascinating and rich histories in all of Eora. Currently holding a position as an incredibly influential group in the Dyrwood, they come from humble beginnings. There may not be a single person in all the Dyrwood who knows exactly how much they owe to the Knights.

The group has existed for years - long before they even came to be known as "knights." They started as a group of blacksmiths, led by Olrun Cyneheod, who came together to form a guild. Olrun felt it imperative for the members to unify, sharing their knowledge through the guild in order to keep the skills and techniques they had spent their lives perfecting. He called the guild "The Crucible," insisting that, though their work was used for destruction, they should always be remembered as creators. They would be known as the vessel that withstands the fire to deliver new form into the world, forged in the fire and all the stronger for the tribulation. Olrun, being a veteran of many battles, knew the importance of impeccably made armor and weaponry. He also espoused the necessity for members of the guild to be trained in martial combat - "The only true way to make a proper suit of armor is to be the one who must wear it."

Olrun led the guild for years, instituting a policy that any man who wanted to join must not only be a skilled blacksmith, but also take the time to learn how to hold himself in battle. He added a training ground to their guild hall and there was scarcely a minute of daylight that didn't see members out on the field, honing their fighting technique. Because of this, the guild earned the nickname ‘Knights of the Crucible.’ They became a de facto militia for the Dyrwood, an honorable group that many turned to for help. They were known to be fair, ethical, and quick to respond.

The Knights chose Abydon as their patron, dedicating their works to his name. To honor him, they incorporated his symbol into their own and wore it on their arms. Many of the Knights took this honor further - regardless of what material a suit of armor was made from, something on the right arm was made with iron, celebrating Abydon's moniker, ‘The Iron Arm.’ Both of these traditions are followed by some of the Knights to this day.

The Knights’ smithing skill led them to be known throughout the land as the premiere artisans of their craft, leading people to call any item of exquisite quality "of the Crucible."

Their training and dedication truly came into play during the War of Defiance (locally known as Hadret's Rebellion). Olrun, knowing the importance winning this war, sent out a call - all able-bodied Knights were to join the militia. They quickly proved invaluable to the cause and helped turned the tide of the rebellion. This was particularly true in the Battle of Defiance Bay. Admeth had already been lost in a previous battle and morale for the Dyrwoodan militia was failing. With the help of Glanfathan astrologers, the Knights were able to rout the imperial forces and secure victory for Dyrwood.

The new duc, grateful for the help, and knowing that without the Knights, the Dyrwood never would have survived, made a decree. The Knights would thenceforth be welcomed into the duc's castle and become his official royal guard.

In recent years, the ‘crucible’ aspect has fallen by the wayside in favor of ‘knight.’ The requirement that the members be proficient in both smithing and martial combat has loosened to the point that anyone who applies is guaranteed entrance, even if they possess little or no smithing experience. This is an allegation that is vehemently denied by the Knights. "</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Anni Iroccio: The New Year

While only 150 years old (and of Vailian origin as well), the Iroccian calendar is currently used throughout most of the Dyrwood and the surrounding areas. While the Dyrwood was using the Aedyran calendar until recently, they gave it up in favor of the Iroccian calendar. The transition was easy to get people to make because the Aedyran calendar was hopelessly inaccurate.

Iroccio calculated that it takes the planet approximately 334 days to orbit the sun, so he took the nine months from the Aedyran calendar and broke them into sixteen months of twenty days each, with each season consisting of four months. The length of each month corresponds to how long it takes Belafa (one of our moons) to circle the planet. At the end of each season, three days - not part of either season - are set aside for people to celebrate the transitions. Lastly, the final two days of the year - New Year and Mid Year - are used to observe the beginning and midpoint of the year.

To prevent any confusion for the transition from the old calendar to the new, Iroccio kept the year the same. So, although the calendar has only been in existence for 150 years, it is currently 2823 AI (Anni Iroccio).

Iroccio gave the months Vailian names, but in the Dyrwood and surrounding areas, they call them by their translated names.

The year is broken down in the following way -

New Year - A day to celebrate the arrival of the new year. Of all the holidays, this one is celebrated by most people around the Dyrwood and the Vailian Republics. Each new year is greeted with a fervent zeal to begin things anew and start with a fresh slate.

Winter Months (Two at the beginning of the year and two at the end)

Deep Winter - Fonivèrno 
Late Winter - Tarivèrno 

Spring Dawn (3 days) - Inprima - Used to celebrate the transition of the world, rebirth, and Spring. Eothasian festivals are especially prevalent at this time, or were, prior to the Saint’s War. 
 
Spring Months

Early Spring - Préprima
Mid Spring - Majprima
Deep Spring - Fonprima
Late Spring - Tarprima

Summer Rising (3 days) - Inestu - A period of transition from birth to growth. Many ceremonies designed to usher children into adulthood take place during Summer Rising.

Summer Months (and Mid Year)

Early Summer - Préëstu
Mid Summer - Majestu

Mid Year - A day of reflection and introspection. The year is half over. People who made promises on New Year use Mid Year to assess their progress and renew their oaths.

Deep Summer - Fonestu
Late Summer - Tarestu

Autumn Falling (3 days) - Inauton - Harvest celebrations happen during Autumn Falling if the crops were particularly bountiful. If the harvest was small, supplication is given to the gods asking for a better harvest the following year.

Autumn Months

Early Autumn - Préauton
Mid Autumn - Majauton
Deep Autumn - Fonauton
Late Autumn - Tarauton

Winter Dusk (3 days) - Inivèrno (ihn-ih-VEHR-no) - Winter Dusk is filled with celebrations of life and vigils for the dead. The world is returning to sleep, plants die, and those still alive raise a toast to another year.

Winter Months

Early Winter - Préïvèrno (pree-ih-VEHR-no)
Mid Winter - Majivèrno (mahzh-ih-VEHR-no)"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Scarcely a decade ago, on the Evon Dewr Bridge, seven men and five women fought valiantly to protect their homeland. They volunteered for the mission knowing it was up to them, and them alone, to prevent St. Waidwen from crossing the bridge. They succeeded, even though they lost all but four of their number in the battle, and Waidwen was on the bridge when the Godhammer detonated. The final four were lost in the blast as well, their sacrifice a testament to their dedication.

The Dozens, a group ostensibly formed for the protection of the Dyrwood, was founded in the honor of those men and women. Indeed, those twelve men and women are posthumously regarded by the Dozens as their true ‘founders.’ Initially, the group dedicated itself to protecting Dyrwood from invasion, patrolling the borders tirelessly in search of Readceran forces regrouping for another attack. When that attack never materialized, many of the Dozens thought the next threat might come from Eothasian loyalists living in Dyrwood and began to turn their attention within.

All new members of the Dozens are required to swear an oath to remember the sacrifice of their founders and remain vigilant against Readceras and any followers of Eothas. To this end, worshipers of Eothas are routinely harassed by the Dozens.

The mindset of this group may be hard for some to understand as any fanatical devotion can sometimes overshadow the ideals. But the original "Dozen" knowingly sacrificed their lives for Dyrwood. From the Dozens’ perspective, how can new members of the Dozens be any less committed to their country’s welfare? What better way could there be to honor their founders?

The Dozens are not a large group, but what they lack in size, they make up in fervent devotion to their cause and a gift for gaining the ear of commoners. This makes them a force to be reckoned with, and there is no more influential group in shaping the discourse surrounding Waidwen’s Legacy. A small but very vocal minority of extremists in the group are calling for a new war with Readceras. Talk of purging the Dyrwood of all followers of Eothas is also being touted. More recently they have begun to see in the practice of animancy a possible cause to the Legacy, and they have taken to the streets of Defiance Bay and the dirt roads of many distant settlements to make their case to the general public. Some point to this as one source of a recent surge in vigilantism and violence in the country."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No other land has such a wild and bloody recent history. From colony to palatinate to free republic, the Dyrwood has undergone a trial by fire to emerge as a powerful force of the Eastern Reach.

Dyrwood's history actually begins in Aedyr in 2602 AI. Aedyre explorers returned from a journey across the ocean with tales of the treasures they'd found. They'd discovered countless ruins scattered through the forests as well as plains to the north of the trees that would be perfect for growing vorlas. There was a problem, however - the locals were hostile and there was potential for conflict. The fercönyng of Aedyr (FAYR-cö-ning, "first king") knew that this was too good an opportunity to pass up and sent more explorers to scout and map the area.

Exploration continued over the next twenty years. Small groups of explorers traveled back and forth between Aedyr and this new world with a handful of colonists setting up small camps to establish a base for the explorers to work out of. Conflicts with the locals - who the Aedyrans learned are called the Glanfathans - were rare, but frequent enough for the fercönyng to send a small squadron of guards to help protect his citizens. These guards established a central base on a river in the western section of the woods. This settlement would eventually become the city of Dyrford (upon which the modern day village of the same name is presently built). Once that base was established, the first permanent Aedyran settlements began north and west of the Bael River. Over the next three years, thousands of Aedyrans made the trek from Aedyr to this new land. The Glanfathans, who seemed to revere the ruins scattered through the forest, caused a few problems with some of the settlements - especially those founded near the ruins themselves. These were easily taken care of by the colonists with the help of the imperial guard. The Aedyrans, in order to further their foothold in the area, reduced the cost of production, and in an attempt to keep the Glanfathan population under control, started making slaves out of any Glanfathans captured during the uprisings. This resulted in a great increase in tension between the two groups.

With the population of the area growing, an official governmental structure was established by the fercönyng. He appointed several erls to preside over the land and assigned them thayns to help run their territories, and they called the new gréfram the Dyrwood. Dyrford remained the center for the imperial guard, but the settlement in Pearlwood Gulf, New Dunryd, was the true seat of power for the area. Sitting at the edge of the ocean, forest, fertile farmland, and a river that runs from the coast to the White March, settlers flocked to the area, hoping to establish names for themselves. Aedyr began to spread across the new land."

      <DefaultText>"As I have stated, not much is known about this group by the world at large because they don't welcome outsiders into their numbers. While many believe they are xenophobic and openly hostile to all who enter Eir Glanfath, the truth doesn't seem to be as broad or deadly - and certainly not that simple. 

There are many places in Eir Glanfath that could be called ‘magical’ or ‘sacred’ to the Glanfathans. One legend states that the Engwithans, who had suddenly abandoned their kingdom and left for places unknown, took the time to guide the ancient Glanfathan tribes into the now vacant land. The Glanfathans were gifted with the fertile area as their new homeland, but in return for being given such a gift, an oath was required. The Glanfathans were instructed to protect the Engwithan ruins until such time as they could return and reclaim the ruins. They were required to swear that no living person, including the Glanfathans themselves, would be permitted entrance into the ruins. Differing accounts suggest that the Glanfathans were promised more than a homeland - that the Engwithans were the favored people of the gods, and that keeping their oaths would confer similar benefits to the Glanfathans in the end. 

Oddly, the rules do not seem to apply as strictly within the borders of Twin Elms, a site built upon a large concentration of Engwithan structures. But it would seem that this is unlikely a selective oversight on the part of the Glanfathans and more probably part of the terms of the original compact.

In any case, the Glanfathans came to take their role as guardians seriously, revering the sites and developing rituals designed to protect and guard the ruins. Over time, these rituals became rote formality to some, as much legend and superstition as any other stories passed down. This is not to say the Glanfathans ceased all attempts to uphold their oath (see the section about the Ten Years Treaties in my book about Admeth Hadret), but the intense devotion to the oath tended to vary from tribe to tribe and clan to clan. Not so with the Fangs, however. The Fangs are a group joined not by ties of kinship or even community, but of belief. Of all the groups of Eir Glanfath, it is the Fangs who seem most intent on keeping the promise their ancestors made to the Engwithans.

Just because their fanaticism and zeal are not as widely sweeping as many think does not make them any less dangerous. The Fangs are not known to reason with those they view as transgressors. If they feel you have in any way have violated the sanctity of a sacred space, their judgment is swift and exact. Reports of the Fangs attacks can be found in records dating back to the first colonial explorations of Eir Glanfath, and even the smallest of a perceived slight can be worthy of execution.

The order itself seems to consist mainly of hunters. Whether they are recruited as skilled hunters or trained once they gain access to the order, it is unknown. From all accounts, once they join the Fangs, hunting game falls second behind patrolling Eir Glanfath and protecting the ruins, so it is the author’s opinion that it is the former."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One day, Eothas was sitting on a wall, watching a cat play in the sun. A crystal, hung in a nearby tree, had fragmented a sunbeam and scattered small motes of light on the ground. They danced around the cat, sliding over him as he frantically batted at them. He spun in place, following one as it rushed past him, and leaped on it, trying to pin it down. Eothas smiled, amused at the animal's tenacity. The cat landed on a spot, placing his paws over it only to watch it flit away again. Eothas watched the cat's tail twitch and slap at the ground, annoyed that his prey could not be pinned.

‘Why must you tease him?' a voice said from behind him, accompanied by the crunch of sandals on gravel.

‘I merely bring the dawn,' Eothas responded. ‘I don't stoke the hunter's heart. That's your responsibility, isn't it?'

‘True,' said a second voice, ‘but neither do you quell it. If the hunter could not see his prey, would he still hunt?'

‘So philosophical, Hylea,' Eothas said and turned to greet the two gods that approached him. ‘Have you come to debate the parallel between sight and desire?' He gestured to the wall, inviting Hylea and Galawain to join him. They sat in silence, watching the cat who continued to hunt the sun, fruitlessly swatting at another mote and then rolling onto his back.

‘I have created the ultimate prey,' Eothas said finally, breaking the silence. ‘It can be tracked. It can be followed. It can be seen. But it can never be caught.' Galawain laughed lightly. ‘You don't agree, Galawain?' Eothas asked.

‘While it's true that your creation is elusive, it hardly can be considered the ultimate prey because it never can be caught.' He paused, his brow furrowed in thought. ‘If that mote of light had substance, the hunter could subdue it. Otherwise, it's merely a dream - truly a fruitless endeavor.'

‘All creatures spend their lives chasing fruitless endeavors,' said Hylea. ‘It is the way of mortality.' Galawain laughed again.

‘I could create a creature - a living creature of flesh and blood - that could never be caught. I make your dream a reality.' Now it was Eothas' turn to laugh.

‘You propose turning a fruitless dream into a fruitless reality! How is this any better?'

‘A life spent in the pursuit of an attainable goal far exceeds any other.'

‘But you just said no one could catch this creature! This is not attainable!'

Galawain smiled. ‘Humanity has surprised us before. Indeed it could surprise us again. I will create a great white stag and I will set it free in the world. It will have grace, resilience, and tenacity. It will exist solely to be pursued for all its days, and it will never be caught. It will serve to inspire the hunt for generations to come. All those who wish for glory will invoke my name. All those who hear its story will ask for my blessing in finding it.'

Hylea shook her head, and threw Galawain a bemused look. ‘I do not believe this is possible. So I, too, make an offer. To the person who catches this stag - and they will catch the stag - I will bestow upon them its grace, resilience, and tenacity. Thrice blessed they will be. They will ask for my blessing on the hunt so they can obtain my boon.'

Galawain and Hylea took up arguing whose name would be invoked more when the hunt was on. Eothas sighed, a small smile playing at the edges of his mouth. He stood and looked to the sky. The sun had already started to hide itself behind the mountains. The cat, long ago tired of the stalking the motes, had fallen asleep beneath the tree. He turned and looked at the other gods, deep in debate, and sighed again.

‘I merely bring the dawn,' he repeated as he made his way down the path, ‘it is up to you to see what I reveal.'"

      <DefaultText>"Look up into the night sky and you'll see the moon Belafa. Ubiquitous and persistent, she remains forever in view but also forever out of reach. What many people do not know, however is that our world is actually orbited by two moons: Belafa and Cawldha.

Belafa

Hanging low and large in the sky, Belafa travels swiftly in her race around the world - completing an orbit in about eighteen days. This proximity and speed can cause extreme tide conditions in some areas, making the seas shift so quickly and rise so high that there are some beautiful coastal areas that are virtually uninhabitable for a good portion of the year. Before we learned the truth behind the cause of the tides, legend held that Ondra, the goddess of the sea, was in love with the moon and when she saw it in the sky the tides, great waves, and violent storms that happened were her attempts to reach it. This is why the moon is formally called Senn Belafa or Ondran Belafa - The Beloved or Ondra's Beloved.

Cawldha

315 years ago, the Grand Empire of Vailia suffered from terrible storms and terrifyingly high and low tides. Records show the same thing was happening in the Aedyr Empire and that several new Aedyran colonies along the Dyrwood coast were completely destroyed by storms and high tides that engulfed the settlements. At that time, during an eclipse, Glanfathan astronomers spotted something small orbiting near the edge of Belafa.

After much study, they realized it was a small satellite with an extremely irregular orbit. They called it Cawldha Debh, or The Black Runner. Since it is smaller than Belafa, it doesn't have much effect on the world, but when it aligns with Belafa's orbit, it wreaks havoc on the tides and weather everywhere. This happens with an erratic frequency and severity and have been dubbed ‘Lovers' Tides.’ Cawldha has been rolled into the Ondra myth and when they are both in sight, her desire to reach them is increased tenfold, which is what causes the terrible weather."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is much debate with historians as to when the Saint's War really began. It is widely accepted that the event that instigated it was the sanctuary flight of Readceran citizens to the Dyrwood. This led to direct strife between the two nations that escalated into battle - The Saint's War.

But it is the author’s opinion that the war truly started many years before.

After the Miracle of the Verdant Vorlas (as it came to be known), Waidwen quickly gathered followers, drawn to the stories of Eothas' miraculous prophet. His power grew. Eventually, Waidwen had gained enough support that he confronted the imperial governor. 

Assisted by a collection knights and nobles who had been swayed to his cause, he marched on the capital city. The governor was allowed to live, but was forced to abdicate power and leave the colony. This was not from any understanding or easy acquiescence from the governor, but because of what happened when Waidwen entered the governor's palace. As Waidwen approached the governor, according to accounts, his body turned into something that was no longer human. His flesh became luminescent and his head transformed into pure, blinding light. (Other accounts suggest that Waidwen had become a being of light at an earlier time, when he was whipped in the public square. The outcome of his visit to the palace, however, is uncontested.)

The governor, knowing there was no way he could oppose an avatar of Eothas, relinquished his power. The people then asked Waidwen to lead the colony. He accepted, earning him the name ‘Divine King’ of Readceras.

Waidwen's rule was virtually uncontested. Initially this was because everyone was awed that a god had chosen to manifest himself and lead his people. This changed as Waidwen began punishing the allies of the old empire and the ‘poison on the world’ - what he considered corrupt churches or church leaders of Eothas. Scrutiny escalated and soon worshipers of Eothas were also being punished for mere perceptions of heresy. Members of other religions were also added to the list of the persecuted for following different faiths. This caused large segments of the population to flee Readceras for the Dyrwood, begging for sanctuary. This caused strife between the two nations. The people of the Dyrwood knew that they could not sustain explosive population growth if Waidwen's rule were to continue unchecked. They also feared that his eye would turn from Readceras and land on them next if nothing was done. This was exactly what ultimately happened, and open war broke out as Waidwen moved to spread his dominion into the lands of Dyrwood."

      <DefaultText>"How long have I been wandering? I can no longer tell. The days in endless white, the cold breath of the wilderness biting at my neck. All I feel is the insistent hand of the wind pushing me forward. Where is it taking me?

Where did it start? On the boat? Was there a boat? I remember one. A storm? And disaster. If I dwell on it long enough, my mind rebels. So I walk. And she appears to me.

How many times has it been? Once? Have I seen her before or is this the first time? Did she ever leave? All my mind can do is ask questions. Each question leads to another question. The answers frighten me.

So I walk.

She stands with her head cast down. Long, white hair hangs in front of her face, obscuring it from my view. She holds out a hand. Pale. Thin. Palm up. She wants my help.

She wants my soul.

Something screams, inhuman and primal. It overtakes me from behind, wrapping me in a terrifying blanket of sound. My skin contracts as chills course through me. I turn to face my pursuer and see only a vast, white emptiness.

She is gone, like every time before. Was this the first time? Has she gone before? My stomach answers with a growl. Hunger. The beast consumes me from the inside and there is no stopping it. I must eat.

I see water. Am I seeing it now? Is this a memory? Confusion slips its fingers inside my head and murmurs softly. I cannot quite hear it. I strain to no avail. The water remains. It must be here. I drop to my knees and hear the whisper-light crack of the ice beneath my knees.

I am sitting in the lee of an ice mountain. The protection it provides does little to prevent the wind from driving the pins of snow into my flesh. I am shaking. Where is my left hand? I move it. Nothing. I look down and see it moving. It is wet and caked with ice. My head falls back against the ice and I press the edges of my memory. My brain whispers back with a soft cracking sound and a scream. Wood on wood. Tearing. Cracking. I close my eyes against the onslaught.

She appears before me again. Again? Time fragments and blows around me like the snow that obscures my vision. I am walking. My hand is on fire. I feel the needles piercing my fingers as she reaches hers out to me. She raises her head, black eyes staring blankly. Her mouth opens and closes - but if she speaks, I cannot hear it.

The scream again. Closer this time. If I still had emotion, I would be quaking. I turn as I have so many times before to see what monster has found me and she is there behind me. She puts her hand on my chest. The cold burns me through my clothes. She leans in, her mouth presses against my ear.

‘We are waiting.’

I open my eyes. I lie on the ground. I see torn fabric, rocks, a broken wooden box. An unsuccessful campfire. Where did it come from? Did I make it? How did I get here? I roll onto my back, unable to stand. Exhaustion sits on my chest and holds me down.

She stands above me. I see frozen tears on her cheeks. She does not move. She does not threaten me. But I know this is the end. Her mouth opens. The inhuman scream that erupts from within her digs through the blackness that shrouds my mind and I see her. The wood that tore beneath her feet. The water that swallowed her.

She fades, replaced by the face of the devil that has followed me. Was it always there? In my madness, did I view it in a different form? Is anything in my mind true? Time bleeds. My vision shimmers, distorting the face that approaches. Its dark eyes watch closely as it walks forward. Its fur is matted and stained. Its fangs glisten in the fading light. Its enormous hands, tipped with jagged blades, rise above my head.

I close my eyes.

‘I am coming.’"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Only the heartiest of explorers would dare take the long, dangerous trek to the Living Lands. While there is no denying its beauty - the diversity of plant life alone is an herbologist’s dream - the inherent risk in blithely trekking through these pristine hills is more than most should undertake.

Let me take a moment to tell you about the land itself - rolling hills, greenery, and sun. The whole area feels like a succession of hills and valleys, each with its own ecosystem. While that declaration is a tad extreme, it can almost be said to be true. The combination of sun, geographical location, proximity to fresh water, valley depth, and the existence of hot springs have given the Living Lands a wide breadth of flora and fauna. Walk down a hillside into a valley and you will find lush, verdant hills. Climb the next rise and you might see nothing but rock and boiling mineral springs. 

And the creatures! In my travels, I've seen it all and this place never ceases to amaze me!

Trolls

I will never forget my encounter with the trolls of the Living Lands. I had just narrowly avoided being consumed by a giant plant (more on that later) and was running as fast as I could to get away from it. I broke the crest of the hill and the valley below was wide, green, wet, and covered with low, thick-branched trees. Vines grew everywhere! Between the trees, across the tops of them, down to the ground - it as a mess of vine and green. Cautiously, I worked my way down toward the basin, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. And it's a good thing I did so! I noticed not all the trees appeared to be trees. I froze, dropping to the ground in an effort to minimize my appearance. One of the trees moved, lumbering slowly away from the cluster. It's then that I realized it was a troll, stepping out from among the group of trees it had been resting against. With a few more steps, I would have walked right into their home! The camouflage these trolls exhibited far exceed any I had ever seen before. I hope to return again in the future and observe them more.

Insects

While I have never seen them, I have read reports of giant insects in the Living Lands. Centipedes, flies, mosquitoes, and hornets all ten times the size you would see them elsewhere! Imagine making camp - you've just gotten everything set up. There's a nice fire going next to your shelter. Something is gently simmering in the cooking pot. You sit down, finally feeling like you can relax after a trying day. You feel a tickling at your feet, insistent and prolonged. Reaching down to brush whatever it is away, your hand comes in contact with something hard, long, and flexible winding its way around your boot. You look down to see a centipede the size of your arm casually making its way over your feet, toward the far side of your camp. You would get out of that camp, wouldn't you? That's exactly what my friend did when he realized he had started his fire over a centipede nest.

Plants

And lest we forget - do not let your guard down around the plants! I had discovered a wonderful collection of giant flowers. They were bright pink and grew in a circle around a central stalk. What an aroma! I lack the words to describe how delectable it was. Sweet, fruity, and light with just a hint of something tangy. Looking closer, I saw some berries growing on the stalk in the center of the flowers. Well, I just had to have them! So I started pushing my way through the flowers. Then the vines growing around the base of the plant began to twitch and the blooms turned toward me. It was at that moment I saw the blooms weren't actually flowers, but hinged jaws! I had been fooled by its camouflage! I quickly retreated, pushing my way back out - just in time. The blooms slammed shut. If I had still been standing there, trying in vain to reach the berries, I wouldn't be writing this book today."</DefaultText>

LAIA: Behold, now comes the fun,
That for which I have waited.
His love is forfeit, her life is forfeit
And all I have worked toward shall be fulfilled.
He says he knows his love
He says no force in the world could keep him from her
But what chance has force against guile?
Never will he find his love for she is no longer his love
The spell cannot be undone except by her &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt;
And by then, it will be too late.
But, wait, he has seen her!

Laia steps back to observe.

FAVIA: Pray, mortal, why have you come here?
These woods are not for your kind.
The affairs of men have no place at this tree.
Leave. Leave ere your welcome lapses!

BERNAT: Foul creature!
Where is my love? What have you done with her?
Always this has been the station for our encounters.
Never before have I seen you.
Where is my love?
Answer. Answer ere my patience lapses!

FAVIA: Fool! This is my land and this is my tree.
Your presence never before has been felt.
Again I say to you leave!
My generosity will not be extended a third time.

Laia steps forward again.

LAIA: Talk? Discussion?
I know the way to hurry the conclusion of this tale!

Laia takes a breath and extends her throat as if she's yelling, a scream comes from the copse of trees where the pŵgra stands.

BERNAT: My love!

Bernat steps forward, brandishing his sword.

BERNAT: Prepare yourself, wretch!
For not even death can stand between me and my love.
I will have her from you
Or you will meet your end.

Bernat moves toward Favia, who closes to fight. They fight. During the fight, Bernat is grievously injured as he delivers the killing blow to Favia. She falls to the ground and as she dies, the spell on her breaks, transforming her back into her delemgan form.

FAVIA: Bernat. Bernat.
My Bernat, my love, what have you done to me?
What was it I said?
What was it I did?
Has our love soured in your heart?

BERNAT: Favia! My love! My life!
What foul sorcery has befallen you?
How have you come to be laid low by my hand?
Fie!
Fie to the gods for such treachery!
Fie to all who stood in our way!

FAVIA: Fear not, my beloved
For now we are together
And together will always will be.
Nothing can keep us apart.
But, lo!
Why is it suddenly so dark? Where has the sun gone?
Where are you? I cannot see you.
I will find you.
I will...

Favia dies.

BERNAT: A curse upon the fiend who has betrayed me!
To hold love in your hand and have it wrenched away.

Bernat winces and puts his hand in his shirt, it comes out covered in blood.

BERNAT: What luck! What chance!
Tragedy may yet turn to fortune!
Favia, my love! Soon I will rest in your arms!
We will lie together again as one and forever shall we be side by side!
I go now to meet my love.
Berath, I accept your cold embrace.
I welcome your company.
I beg your mercy.

Bernat lies down next to Favia's body.

BERNAT: I am ready.

Bernat dies.

Laia steps out from her hiding spot and runs to Bernat's body.

LAIA: Bernat! You fool! You wretch!
How can you leave me?
I am alone! I am forgotten! I am cast out!
Without your love, how can I continue?
Life holds no thrall without your visage upon which I may gaze.
What shall I do?
But here! My salvation! My answer!

Laia picks up Bernat's sword.

LAIA: His blade. His weapon.
I shall be impaled upon him and he shall cut through me.
I will not be denied my love!
I will not be denied, my love!
You will be mine! If not in this life, then in the next!

Laia impales herself on the sword.

LAIA: I come for you, my love, my Bernat!
Wait for me and I will find you!
We shall love forever!

      <ID>1579</ID>
      <DefaultText>"In 2626 AI, a group of farmers, while clearing farmland for planting, accidentally knocked down one of the ancient adra menhirs on their land. This innocent act drew the ire of the native population and started what would come to be known as the Broken Stone War. When it was finally over, several thousand colonists have been killed as well as hundreds of the Glanfathans. Even though the war was technically over, the Glanfathans escalated their attacks on the settlers over the next two years using vicious tactics that left many colonists, several military figures, an erl, and six thayns dead.

Unable to stop the Glanfathan attacks, the erls elected erl Edrang Hadret to the position of gréf . Well respected and known to be a master of military tactics, he was tasked with dealing with the Glanfathan threat. Edrang fought with the Glanfathans, led by an orlan named Regd, for the next two years. Neither side can gain the upper hand on the other resulting in a tense stalemate between the two groups. Because of this stalemate, the hostilities slowly died off and in 2631, the Dyrwoodan people signed a treaty with the Glanfathans. Regd would step down, the Glanfathans would stop their attacks altogether, and the Dyrwoodan people would leave the ruins alone. This treaty angered the nobility in Aedyr, as it brought to a halt the supply of artifacts. Edrang also tried to get the practice of slavery outlawed, but this was not successful. Because of this, the peace between the Dyrwood and Eir Glanfath is uneasy and tumultuous. Small patches of rural violence still cropped up, but were easily dealt with, as neither side wanted another war."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"After the Broken Stone War, the Dyrwood would see peace and prosperity for 21 years. Aside from the occasional slave uprising or border dispute, nothing of any note happened until 2652 AI. Some of the Dyrwoodan erls, tired of being restricted by the treaties, and encouraged by imperial sources, defied the decrees and actively sent people to loot the ruins in the Dyrwood. Response from the Glanfathans was not immediate, but when it came it was brutal and bloody. There was a slave uprising and Regd resumed control of his guerrilla fighters. A contingent of delemgan joined the forces as well, making the fights in the forest even more deadly for the Dyrwoodan soldiers.

Edrang, then far too old to lead Dyrwood in the war, sent his son Admeth to deal with the situation. Admeth, showing the same tactical prowess as his father, set fire to the forest at the Isce Uar River and then blocks the forces retreating from the inferno. Some of the Glanfathans escape, but thousands would die in the blaze. Regd is captured and sent to holding in New Heomar. The goes on for several months and Admeth uses this same tactic many times to flush Glanfathans and delemgan from the battlefield. The entire war lasts less than a year. The Dyrwood eventually wins, but at a terrible price. This conflict would come to be known as The War of Black Trees.

Tragedy struck the Dyrwood in 2654 when Edrang, whose health had been waning, succumbed and passed into the Cycle. Regd, who had developed a begrudging respect for his constant adversary over the years they had fought, sent Admeth his sincere condolences from captivity in New Heomar. Admeth assumed his father's place as gréf over the Dyrwood. The other erls disliked this development and began publicly rebuking Admeth's decrees. In 2655 AI, Admeth, tired of the problems caused by the recalcitrant erls, but having support of the new Vailian ducs and the common folk of Dyrwood (having saved them from the Glanfathans) delivers an ultimatum to the fercönyng of Aedyr. He demands to be made a gréf palatine. This move would give him authority and power over all the erls, their holdings, and their titles. Dyrwood would become a palatinate instead of a gréfram. The fercönyng, who did not want to have to deal with a rebellion while trying to establish a hold on the vorlas trade network in Readceras, begrudgingly agreed to Admeth's demands. Admeth would use this new power to bring all the erls in line. As a trade-off for being given the power, Admeth put money and resources into all of the Dyrwood's ports to increase shipping traffic. In turn, this increased the fercönyng's income.

Under Admeth's rule, the Dyrwood saw seven productive and profitable years. In 2662 AI, he did what had been tried for many years without success - bringing slavery to an end in the Dyrwood. He negotiated the ‘Ten Years’ treaties (so called because it has been ten years since The War of Black Trees). A timeline was established in which the slaves will be released. The owners would be compensated with money or land for each slave released. If they did not comply, the slaves would be taken and a fine will be levied against the owner. In return, the Glanfathans would open trade with the Dyrwood and cede some of their territories to the Dyrwoodan government (in practice meaning they would stop contesting the presence of those who lived and ruled there). Hundreds of coopers attempted to rebel against this. Admeth, expecting just such a reaction, reacted accordingly and the rebellion was quickly crushed. His agents then spread propaganda through the populace, making the Coopers' Rebellion and its instigators seemed far worse than they truly were. This tactic worked and there would be no more trouble."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Animancy, outlawed while under Aedyr rule, was technically no longer taboo after Hadret’s Rebellion. Academics began its study again in earnest in 2681 AI. By 2697 AI, there were almost 40 academics actively researching the field both in the Dyrwood and the Vailian Republics, even though no significant results had been discovered. A tragic breakthrough of sorts happened in 2704 AI. An animancer working in Baelreach accidentally shattered the souls of about a dozen volunteers who had been helping him. In retaliation for the deaths, the citizens of the area stormed his house and killed him. The erl of the region, not wanting to waste resources or anger the locals any more than they already were, did nothing to find the head of the vigilante mob, but neither did he outlaw animancy. To ensure their own safety, most animancers moved from the rural areas where they were studying and settled in Defiance Bay, many of them choosing the emerging and wealthy district of Brackenbury as their new home of operations. 

While there were still a few breakthroughs and the study of animancy continued for the next 24 years, it quickly slowed as it became cost-prohibitive and complicated the more people learned about it. Most animancers couldn't afford to continue research without the support of donations or gifts from wealthy individuals and organizations. In 2737 AI, some animancers, desperate to continue their studies and seeing no other means of furthering their research, entered the forbidden ruins of Eir Glanfath to further their research. They discovered some such sites had strange artifacts that seemed to bear affinity to soul essence, and began to prod at the devices for further insight. Even with continued research, they are unable to tell quite what they have discovered. Eventually they were found out by the Glanfathans, who captured some of them, demanding they be punished for their crimes. The Dyrwoodan authorities, in order to maintain their treaties and keep the peace, had no choice - they allowed the animancers to be executed according to Glanfathan tradition. This led the duc to make an additional proclamation - the study and practice of animancy on, or even near, the sacred Glanfathan sites, would be punishable by death.

In 2780 AI, in order to solidify relations again with the Glanfathans, the Dyrwoodan government allowed some animancers to begin training and experiments in conjunction with the Glanfathan ‘mind hunters’ - their native ciphers. This was an exchange of information. The animancers documented the secrets of the mind hunters powers. The mind hunters learned new techniques for concentration which assisted them in taking their powers to a level no Glanfathan had seen before. The ciphers, no longer wary of the animancers intentions, trusted them to such a level that they convinced the Glanfathans to give some animancers limited access to some of the training sites where the Glanfathans practiced. The anamfaths of the Glanfathan tribes opened the training grounds to the animancers. They were not allowed inside - as this was still strictly forbidden - but the general allowances by the Glanfathans were seen as a breakthrough in relations between the Dyrwood and Eir Glanfath. Over the next eight years, the animancers’ research would continue unimpeded. With the exception of some minor squabbles, there has been no major strife between the two groups for almost 120 years since."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In 2807 AI, war returned to the Dyrwood. St. Waidwen, transformed supposedly into a living incarnation of Eothas, marched on the Dyrwood from Readceras, beginning The Saint's War. The Dyrwood rallied at Halgot Citadel and took the battle to him in Readceras, attempting to prevent as much damage to their own land as they could. Even though there were devastating losses for the Dyrwoodan forces, using Hadret's military techniques combined with Galven Regd's strategies, they were able to secure a few victories for themselves as well. Readceran forces made their way into the Dyrwood through White March - unopposed by the locals at Cold Morn - leaving Mercy Vale burned and devastated. The contempt the Dyrwoodans have for Cold Morn for this betrayal lasts well after the war ends.

Desperate to end the war and eliminate St. Waidwen, the Magranic clergy of Dyrwood developed a special bomb that was hidden beneath the bridge at Halgot Citadel. Intending to lure Waidwen to the bridge and then detonate it. Their ploy succeeded and St. Waidwen was completely destroyed, along with most of the forces with him and the entire bridge. The twelve Dyrwoodan men and women who volunteered to delay St. Waidwen on the bridge were also lost, their sacrifice and martyrdom celebrated by the Dyrwood in the ensuing years. The bomb would come to be known as the Godhammer, and soon after the battle, the citadel was renamed ‘Godhammer Citadel.’ St. Waidwen's forces were easily routed after his death and the Dyrwood set about rebuilding from the first major conflict in over a century. In retaliation for St. Waidwen's action on Eothas' part, many Eothasian followers were purged from Dyrwoodan communities or driven out via social pressure.

Less than a year after the devastation of The Saint's War, tragedy hit again. In 2809 AI, the first Hollowborn was reported in the Dyrwood. Many of these poor creatures died within weeks or months of being born. The outcry from the populace calls for blame or punishment be leveled against someone, whether it be the gods, the mothers, the government, or the Eothasian followers. 

Responding to great sociopolitical pressure to try and help the Hollowborn, animancers developed a process to transplant animal souls into the infants, that they might develop survival instincts and even a basic personality. The process seemed successful, so it was repeated on tens of thousands of Hollowborn, even though many animancers disagreed with the technique, worried about the ethical implications. These protests were largely ignored and discounted. The process was soon named "Salvation" and the Hollowborn given souls this way were called the "Saved."

Five years after the first Hollowborn - an orlan girl - is saved, she entered puberty. In a matter of mere weeks, she transformed into a ravenous, feral creature devoid of all conscience. Soon, all of the Saved would experience the same fate. Each one, upon reaching puberty, would transform into what the locals called ‘wichts’ (uncontrollable children). After researching the problem, animancers discovered an incompatibility between the animal souls and the children’s bodies. This fueled the parents' anger (as many of them had to kill their wicht children). The animancers responsible were widely denounced and many of them were dragged from their homes, beaten, and - in many case - killed. Most surviving animancers left the rural areas en masse and headed to Defiance Bay. Others left the area completely, moving to the Vailian Republics to study in peace."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The rural communities loved Admeth Hadret, considering him the best leader they'd ever had. In Aedyr, the fercönyng rankled against his usurpations of imperial authority, but no longer had the necessary power to truly undo anything that had happened.

Two years later, in 2664 AI, the fercönyng found allies willing to explore the ruins (against the treaty conditions) and plundered them for their artifacts. This was done discretely at first, but they eventually became careless. The agents were discovered and arrested, but there was no evidence pointing back to the fercönyng. Admeth, suspecting the truth, used Glanfathan brishalgwin (‘mind hunters’) - the progenitors of modern day ciphers - to investigate the matter further. With this method of interrogation, he discovered a chain of evidence all the way back to the fercönyng. While he investigated, many rural communities suffered retaliatory attacks by Glanfathans.

Armed with this new information, Admeth worked with Galven Medhra (the new leader of the Glanfathans) and the rural communities of the Dyrwood to prevent the fercönyng's agents from entering the ruins. There was a back and forth between the two groups, both sides engaging in various political, economic, and military maneuvers to try and gain the upper hand. The fercönyng was at a disadvantage in this game, though, as he preferred to assert his authority without causing an uprising.

Eventually Admeth had enough. He convinced seven of the nine erls to join him and they severed their allegiance to the fercönyng, declaring themselves independent and decree they would govern themselves, just as the Vailian republics did twenty years prior. Admeth told the people he had tired of policies that made the nobles rich while putting the people of the Dyrwood at risk. He declared himself a duc (again, modeled after the Vailian Republic's governing structure) and called the Dyrwood a ‘free’ palatinate. Thus began The War of Defiance in 2668 AI. The war lasted four years and caused countless casualties, including Admeth himself. The Dyrwoodans, with their Glanfathan allies were able to persevere. Glanfathan astrologers, alongside the Dyrwoodan forces and members of the ad hoc Knights of the Crucible militia, won the Battle of Defiance Bay, which became the last battle of the war and left Dyrwood free from Aedyran imperial rule. Seven of the nine erls of the Dyrwood survived and, unified in purpose, signed treaties with the fercönyng of Aedyr. The war gave the Dyrwood a greater sense of unity between its citizens and their Glanfathan allies. Admeth Hadret was revered by both groups and the Dyrwood enjoyed for the first time a nationwide fellowship of independence, perseverance, and sacrifice. Yenwood and Cwynsrun were dissolved and incorporated into the surrounding erldoms, leaving seven - Helsgate, The Grasp, Tenferths, Norwaech, Coldwater, Ashfall, and Baelreach. New Dunryd was renamed Defiance Bay and would become the seat of power for the new duc in Baelreach. The new duc’s rule began in 2672 AI."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"In 2602 AI, Aedyran explorers returned from over the ocean, telling tales of the ruins and treasures there and of expansive fields that were perfect for growing vorlas. The explorers warned the fercönyng that the locals were not friendly to outsiders, but the fercönyng, seeing this as an opportunity to extend his empire and secure trade on another continent, sent more explorers. Over the next twenty years, the area that would become the Dyrwood was investigated, mapped, and colonized. In 2623, the first permanent Aedyran colonial settlements were established.

Vorlas fields were set up north of the forests in the Dyrwood, but between the conflicts with the Glanfathans and the War of the Broken Stone, it floundered. It wasn’t until 2643 that the opportunity presented itself again. Some Eothasian pilgrims, wanting to escape persecution, established colonies and vorlas farming operations in the territory of Readceras. With Grand Vailia on the verge of collapse, the fercönyng wanted to ensure his hold on the purple dye trade would be established. He encouraged the settlement and even paid to have the pilgrims set up in the new world.

Because the fercönyng was still trying to secure his name in the purple dye trade, he was unable to properly respond to Admeth Hadret when he issued his ultimatum. To avoid a rebellion and leave himself time to oversee the vorlas farms in Readceras, the fercönyng relented and made Admeth a gréf palatine. In return for this concession, Admeth spent time and resources on the Dyrwood's trade and shipping routes, benefiting the fercönyng with increased income.

For seven years, the Dyrwood provided Aedyr with a steady income, leaving the fercönyng time to ensure his trade system in Readceras was strong. With the fercönyng's attention elsewhere, Admeth instituted the ‘Ten Years’ treaties, ending slavery in the Dyrwood and permanently removing one of the revenue sources provided by the Dyrwoodan explorers - the artifacts from the ruins scattered throughout the Dyrwood. At this point, the fercönyng's word meant almost nothing to the citizens of the Dyrwood. Admeth Hadret had replaced him as their true leader.

In order to undermine Admeth's standing, the fercönyng found allies willing to explore the ruins (against the treaty conditions) and plunder them. Soon, Aedyr again had a supply of artifacts to sell. When his agents were eventually caught, the fercönyng distanced himself from the operation, certain there was no way to link him to the proceedings.

But the gréf, using means provided to him by his Glanfathan allies, discovered the evidence needed to prove the fercönyng was behind the plunderers. The conflict that arose from this revelation led to Admeth declaring independence for the Dyrwood in 2668 AI. After a bloody four-year-long war that resulted in the death of Admeth, the fercönyng relented. Trying to keep control of the Dyrwood had become too costly. He signed treaties with the new duc of the Dyrwood and returned his attention to Readceras, redoubling efforts on the vorlas trade, which is still running today."

      <DefaultText>"In 2652, everything started to deteriorate. It was uncovered that a number of ruin sites had been looted and all signs pointed to the Aedyrans breaking the treaty. Glanfathans held off judgment for as long as they could, but when the evidence became overwhelming, they retaliated with all the strength they could muster. Regd once again took up the mantle of leadership and led his people against the Aedyrans. Instead of facing Edrang Hadret again, this time Regd crossed swords with Admeth Hadret, Edrang's son. Admeth proved to be just as, if not more, capable than his father and used a tactic no Glanfathan expected. In order to clear out the battlefield and ensure there would be no place for troops to hide, Admeth set the entire forest on fire near the Isce Uar River, and blocked all retreating forces with his army. While some escaped the slaughter, most of the Glanfathan troops died. Regd was captured in the mayhem and transferred to New Heomar for holding. While many more battles occurred - some of which resulted in Admeth using the same tactic - the Glanfathan forces were now disorganized and had lost their resolve. They were easily routed and by the end of that same year, the War of the Black Trees (as it is now known) was over.

In order to again repair relations between the two groups, Admeth introduced new laws restricting the taking of new slaves from Eir Glanfath. The laws also gave Glanfathans the opportunity to buy their fellows out of bondage. While not entirely happy with the prospect of having to buy their countrymen - who had already been free - the Glanfathans took this gesture as the good will it was and ceased their hostilities again. Seven years pass with the Dyrwood under Admeth's rule. The Glanfathans felt, for the first time, that true peace could return to their land. This peace lead to what is likely the biggest treaty negotiation between Eir Glanfath and the Dyrwood in its history. Admeth set into place the "Ten Years" Treaties (so named because it had been ten years since the War of Black Trees). A timeline was set, and at the end of it all Glanfathan slaves had to be released. The citizens of Eir Glanfath watched the Dyrwood with a cautious hope. With the extended peace between the two peoples and these new treaties, they truly hoped conflict was a thing of the past.

In 2665, Galven Medhra, an elven woman who had taken over for Regd, brought news to Admeth. Some Dyrwoodan people were found taking artifacts from one of the tombs. Initial investigation uncovered several more that had already been plundered. As they seemed to be isolated incidents and it had been stopped early, Medhra did not want a war to start again after so long being at peace. Admeth was grateful for this courtesy and wasted no time tracking down who was responsible. Medhra gave Admeth use of her brishalgwin ‘mind hunters’ and with their help found evidence pointing directly back to the fercönyng. Admeth and Medhra, now jointly allied against the Aedyran fercönyng, used everything at their disposal to prevent the fercönyng's agents from getting into the ruins.

In 2668 AI, when Admeth declared independence from Aedyr to create the Free Palatinate of Dyrwood, the Glanfathans stood behind him, offering their support and troops. While the war didn't affect the Glanfathan people directly, there were casualties. In the end, the Dyrwoodan people became free and the bond between the two people was strengthened through their shared suffering. Admeth became the beloved as ruler of the Dyrwood - known and respected by Dyrwoodans and Glanfathans alike."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Commander and Forge Master

Once a path is chosen, the Knight's life is spent training in his preferred discipline. The pomp and formalities that surrounded his life up to this point are all but gone. The training is far more rigorous and there is less ceremony to mark his progress. For most Knights, Commander (Body) or Forge Master (Soul) are further than they will ever advance. The training of a Knight at this level, while almost exclusively in the discipline he has chosen, is still rounded out with instruction from the other. A Knight is not truly a Knight if he does not have a full breadth of knowledge. When he passes from Justiciar to Commander, the Knight is given a blue cape to wear with his plate armor. When a Templus rises to the position of Forge Master, he is presented with a white cloak.

Marshal and Crucilar

After time spent training, an elite Knight that shows true leadership potential and promise is elevated to the next level. A Knight of the Body becomes a Marshal and a Knight of the Soul becomes a Crucilar. At this point, he is in command of a small group of Knights, Commander/Forge Master and below. He is responsible for the recruitment, initiation, and advancement of new Squires. Many Knights do not want to advance to this level and beyond because the role becomes less hands-on and more advisory. Marshals are known by their purple capes while Crucilars are distinguished by a gold cloak. 

Lord Justiciar and Grand Templus

A Marshal or Crucilar that shows true and effective command over the Knights in his keeping may be offered the position of Lord Justiciar (of the Body) or Grand Templus (of the Soul). Truly a command position, a Knight that accepts one of these roles will be removed from the front lines. Because of this, it is only the most dedicated leaders that take either of these positions.

Lord Marshal and Grand Crucilar

There is not a single Knight that oversees the entire group. This responsibility is split between the Lord Marshal (Body) and the Lord Crucilar (Soul). Any Knight that advances to this position does so only with the support of the Knights as a whole. He must be nominated and selected by a majority of the Knights. Once in the position, he is there for life. The Lord Marshal or Lord Crucilar may step down from his post if he so chooses, but that is only to retire from the life of a Knight. The stress and responsibility of this position is such that many refuse it, even if they are capable of handling it. Lord Marshals and Crucilars are well known and generally respected throughout the land, not just within the Knights."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Over the five years following his ascension to gréf , Admeth attempted to mend relations with the Glanfathans and bring his land together with theirs. He enacted laws that restricted the taking of new slaves, allowed Glanfathans to buy their fellows out of bondage, and imposed a tax on slave ownership in order to promote the use of free labor. While there was some resistance to these new laws, the fercönyng's attention to Readceras and Admeth's power (backed by the colonists), made it difficult for the erls to truly resist what was happening.

In 2662 AI, in the year of the tenth anniversary of the War of Black Trees, Admeth brought about the end to slavery in the Dyrwood. He negotiated a series of treaties with the Glanfathans wherein a timeline was established for the official emancipation of all remaining slaves. Each owner would receive compensation in either land or money based on the number of slaves freed. If they didn't comply, the slaves would be seized and their former masters would suffer a substantial fine. In return for this, the Glanfathans opened trade routes with the Dyrwood and allowed Dyrwoodans to live in and near areas that had their sacred ruins but they are, under no conditions, to enter the ruins. As a final act of good will, Admeth freed Galven Regd, saying he had suffered sufficiently for his actions.

The fercönyng, seeing he was completely out of control in his own palatinate, devised a plan to get the supply of ancient artifacts running again. He approached the erls suffering under Admeth's rule and convinced them to hire agents to raid the ruins. Initially, they did so in secret, but they quickly become sloppy, eventually being caught. This breach of the treaties incited Glanfathans again to acts of violence while Admeth researched who was behind it.

With help of the Glanfathan leaders, Admeth found evidence that pointed back to the fercönyng as the source of the raids. That was the beginning of the end for Aedyran rule in the Dyrwood. Over the next seven years, Admeth and the fercönyng maneuvered around each other, playing political, economic, and military games in order to gain the upper hand. In 2668 AI, Admeth declared the Dyrwood had had enough. The fercönyng would no longer be recognized - the Dyrwood was now a free entity and would govern itself. This started the War of Defiance which lasted five years.

The end result of the war was freedom for the Dyrwood, and though Duc Hadret would never live to see it come to a close, the people of Dyrwood consider him the founder of the country nevertheless."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Waidwen personally led many of the battles during the war, exhibiting extraordinary supernatural powers. He seemed virtually untouchable on the battlefield, able to burn or even disintegrate his enemies with beams of blinding, white light. With a god on his side and possibly, as some said, inhabiting him, he was thought to be indestructible.

It appeared that he may have been, until the Battle of Halgot Citadel. The people of the Dyrwood knew they would lose the war if they could not at least slow Waidwen down. Engineers, priests of Magran, and a few others, working in secret (some say with Magran’s direct help), developed a weapon they hoped would be able to stop a god. Twelve feet in diameter and filled with a variety of chemical and magical explosives, the bomb was rolled under Evon Dewr Bridge. Part of the foundation was excavated in order to allow them to embed the bomb in the bridge itself, ensuring its total concealment.

Twelve Dyrwoodan men and women volunteered to stage and ambush at the bridge to keep Waidwen on it until the bomb could be detonated. The battle was short, bloody, and ultimately final. ‘The Dozen’ (as they came to be known) were able to delay Waidwen on the bridge. The bomb detonated, killing Waidwen, the four Dyrwoodan volunteers still alive at that time, and over fifty Readceran soldiers marching on the front line with Waidwen.

It was at that moment The Saint's War ended. The remaining Readceran forces were easy to rout. Even though they had more than enough men and equipment to finish the siege, their leader - previously thought invincible - had just vanished in a rain of metal and stone. Panic set in and the Dyrwoodan troops sent them away with ease.

From that point on, the bomb was known by the name ‘Godhammer.’ It even worked its way into everyday conversation. "As sure as Godhammer ended the Saint's War," came to be a standard phrase to express unequivocal certainty. Less certain is the fate of Eothas, who has not spoken to his followers since the explosion of the bomb and is presumed by most to be dead.

Lest some concerned citizens express their worry or other more industrious think they could reproduce the result, the author would put the thoughts from your heads. Since that time, there has never been another documented explosion of such magnitude, and efforts to locate the engineers and clergy responsible for the bomb have been entirely fruitless. Godhammer was a unique, fortuitous occurrence. Its like will never be seen again without divine intervention."</DefaultText>

INJURED MAN: A balm? A salve? Surely you know compassion. Surely you can spare anything, even your time, to help me!
MALE: This man is injured and cannot help himself. He is certain to die if someone does not apply ointment and bandages to his wounds. Such compassion could mean his life.
FEMALE: You owe nothing to this man. Surely his injuries are the judgment of his god. He has been tried and found wanting. His punishment is none of your concern.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: What will you do?

The man weighs his options, then kneels down beside the Injured Man. He administers ointment on the man's wounds and wraps a bandage around them.

INJURED MAN: Bless you! May the compassion you show to those less fortunate be shown to you all your days!

MALE &amp; FEMALE: Why did you dress the wounds of the injured?

MAN: I saw a man who was bent and broken. It is not for me to say he has no right to his health, only to help heal if I am able. I have the time to give, so I give. If I can help in a man's rebirth, it is my duty to do so.

MALE (aside, to Female): He knows Compassion, even disguised as an injured man. His spirit is willing.
FEMALE (aside, to Male): Even those with a willing spirit can refuse those in need.

MALE &amp; FEMALE: We will continue our journey.
 
They walk to the center of the stage where the Beggar, Starving Man, and Injured Man now stand.

MALE: What say you three? What is the nature of this man's soul?

BEGGAR: I am Charity. I know the mind of one who gives freely. This man was willing to give me his last coin. His mind is righteous. His soul is pure.
STARVING MAN: I am Generosity. I know the heart of one who withholds nothing from those in need. This man was willing to give me his last scrap of bread. His heart is giving. His soul is pure.
INJURED MAN: I am Compassion. I know the spirit of one who will sacrifice for the greater good. This man was willing to stay with a stranger and care for him in his time of need. His spirit is merciful. His soul is pure.

MALE: What say you, Magran?
FEMALE: The trial is complete. The judgment has been made. The decision is final. This man has shown Charity, Generosity, and Compassion to those in need. His soul will be reborn. What say you, Eothas?
MALE: The judgment is final. The decision has been made. (He turns to the man) Be on your way. Your soul's transformation has begun. Welcome the light of the new dawn."

We climbed to the roof, when the water reached the top of the stairs. My three children, Nathe, Leibelsa, and Kyrre, we held. The water reached our chests, and the only thing that kept us from getting swept away before it subsided was holding onto the chimney, that we had just repaired. Other families were not so lucky.

When the waters finally subsided, the roads were littered with debris, mud, and rotting fish. Half the district had been swallowed by the sea. Bodies floated in the tide along with what was left in the homes. We burned the citizens we found. The poor souls have nobody else to remember them by, so I'll document them here. I'm not sure if they had loved ones who survived the flood, but it is better their names be written down rather than washed away with so much else in this horrific flood."

      <DefaultText>How fitting that we know the god of cycles, doorways, mortality, and inevitability as Berath, while the Vailians know this very same god as Cirono. For if nothing else, Berath teaches us that duality exists in all things. There is Life in &lt;xg&gt;Death&lt;/xg&gt;, and &lt;xg&gt;Death&lt;/xg&gt; in Life - embrace this duality and you honor Berath.

In the ruins Eir Glanfath, Berath is depicted in the form of two semi-skeletal figures - one male, one female - Bewnen i Ankew and Ankew i Bewnen - literally, Life in &lt;xg&gt;Death&lt;/xg&gt; and &lt;xg&gt;Death&lt;/xg&gt; in Life in the Glanfathan tongue. Male and female, inside and outside, life and death - we often think of Berath by imagining two sides of coin, or the two end points of a journey.

It said that Berath has the most petitioners of every god, and this likely true - who amongst us has not prayed for the cycle to hiccup? Who has not, in a moment of sadness, yelled at Berath to make an exception for our fallen loved ones?

Berath may not rescue our loved ones but it answers our prayers in its own, divine way. Berath is the god that makes life end in death, and it is also the god that makes death end in life. Berath, Cirono, Bewnen I Ankew, Ankew I Bewnen - whichever of the many names you prefer to use - deserves our prayers, for it has given us the promise of life's eternal renewal.

      <DefaultText>Sing, oh ocean waves, of Ondra's sorrow - of her unrequited love for the unattainable moon! Sing of the ocean's sorrow, so that we may forget our own! Each day, the tides reenact Ondra's longing for the great moon - the waters reach out at high tide, yearning for the heavenly body, only to slump into low tide when the moon proves unattainable.

You asked me once why I loved Ondra so dearly - how I could go from a life on dry land to being a devotee to the Goddess of the Oceans. I sing of the ocean's sorrow so that I may forget my own. It is Ondra's message that speaks to my heart - I have devoted my life to helping others discard painful memories, for that is the gift Ondra gave me. When I lost my young daughter, my wife and I were inconsolable until a Giftbearer offered to take my toddler's toys and cast them into the deepest waters. 

Truth be told, I and the other Giftbearers I know have never even spoken to Ondra... she is largely silent and when she does 'speak' she uses floods and tidal waves instead of words. But we sing of the ocean's sorrow so that others may forget theirs. Ondra's story - the story of desire unanswered - actually matters to people like you and me. Magran cannot steer you to victory over sadness, Hylea cannot force joy down a crying throat... only Ondra can give us the strength to persevere when life seems without worth. And that is the answer to your question regarding why I love my Goddess so dearly.

      <DefaultText>Young students are often confused by Berath and Rymrgand's seemingly overlapping roles in holding dominion over &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt;. Berath oversees the cycle of life, &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt;, and rebirth; Rymrgand oversees the cold, destructive act of &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt; itself - this difference is often difficult for novices to appreciate until they've lost a loved one and endured the absence for a time - it is Berath that determines we will be reborn just as certainly as we will die, but Rymrgand is the executioner's axe - Rymrgand shows us that all life ends in stillness.

I need only show them the symbol of Rymrgand - the bone-white aurochs skull found carved within the most ancient of Engwithan ruins... it is a symbol of &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt; and doom in every culture - any child with four winters under his belt needs no introduction to the ancient symbol.

Rymrgand embodies not just &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt;, but all manifestations of collapse - be they famine, plague, or simple bad luck. Rymrgand is a primal god, silent and inscrutable as &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt; itself. He makes himself known with his passing, not by proclamation. There are innumerable stories of the god's terrifying passage through the lands of Eora. When the Beast of Winter stirs, bitter winds and beastly howling follow the creature's every move. Wherever the beast plants a hoof, all life withers into dust. The faithful of Rymrgand insist that even another god's life can end in stillness, they claim the other gods must flee from the Beast of Winter's mastery over &lt;xg&gt;death&lt;/xg&gt; - but we know not if this boast holds true.

Though the Beast of Winter is shrouded in snowy clouds, those who have seen the shaggy white monster claim that the souls of the fallen can be seen clinging (or perhaps frozen) to the beast's fur. The dwarves of the boreal south have numerous stories that tell a similar plot: a brash hero seeks out the Beast of Winter to rescue the souls trapped in its fur... these tales never end well, for even if the hero saves his beloved's soul, the hero dies in the process - for it is not a proper tale of Rymrgand unless the hero's life ends in stillness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dear Sisters,

Do you still remember your first deliverance? When you strangled your first wrongdoer, did you see the moment when life became death? Could you see the instance when your victim realized that Woedica forgets nothing? When Woedica takes back her throne will you face her with pride, knowing you have held to your own oaths, or will you be amongst the word-breakers?

Woedica teaches vengeance and memory - and while she is in Exile, we must be her eyes and ears that let no injustice slip from record, we must be clenched fist that silences the lying breath. When Woedica takes back her throne, all of the injustices that have slipped through the cracks of history will be righted. The villains hiding in plain sight amongst the innocent will feel the Burned Queen's choking grasp - pray that you live to see the day when you will join our Queen in this cleansing of the wicked.

But know, my sisters, that we must be ready to see the end of our days without the return of our Queen - for she will take back her throne, but it may be our daughters that serve the restored court. We must continue to live as we have always lived - hated by the other faiths, even though we place justice above our own well-being. At least the Empire of Aedyr still holds our creed in proper esteem. It is a proper sign of respect that, by imperial custom, our clergy must oversee a contract for it to be legally binding. For who else understands the value of remembering one oaths than Woedica's faithful? And let us not count our current blessings - for we still enjoy the support of the paladin order of The Steel Garrote - they too understand that society is built and broken by the oaths and rules of its people.

When Woedica takes back her throne, my family will know that I was right to commit my life to the Exiled Queen. When Woedica takes back her throne, the Strangler will stop being a story told to frighten our daughters, but a hero woven into parables that teach our children justice. When Woedica takes back her throne, she will bring her flawless memory with her - every transgression, every crime, and every injustice will be revealed. When Woedica takes back her throne, even gods won't be spared their due retribution.

      <ID>1719</ID>
      <DefaultText>Ten years I tilled the vorlas leaf, and ten years I told myself that living in St. Waidwen's footsteps would bring me rebirth. Each dawn I'd pray that if thou art in darkness, he shall bring thee light, and each yet each night would bring the same emptiness. For my decade of living as a simple dye farmer, all I have to show for it is a great deal of purple clothing.

Eothas has not spoken to us since he appeared as St. Waidwen. It was my hope that Eothas would claim me as his next vessel but alas... the Child of Light remains silent. Every day I practice the ritual of banishing the shadows of the unfaithful... and every day I work my fields in solitude, without sign of Eothas returning. If thou art in darkness, he shall bring thee light, but how long must I remain lost in this long night of abandonment?

Is this my punishment for keeping my faith a secret? Is Eothas hiding from me until I shout my reverence for all to hear? Surely, He must know that the Dyrwoodans now hate Him and His followers... my countrymen are quick to blame all that was terrible about the Saint's War on those of us still faithful to Eothas. Should they not be angry at the Readceras soldiers? Do the Dyrwoodans not realize that to dismiss the god of rebirth and redemption is to prevent all hope of healing?

As I pen these words, I know that I must continue to till the dye-leaf. I will awake each day with hope: if thou art in darkness, he shall bring me light. Each day I will pray that the Dawnstars visit me, just as they visited St. Waidwen in his field of vorlas. Will they come to me as they came to St. Waidwen? As a man and two women, luminescent and perfect? I am told they come to presage new times... I am told many things, and I struggle to find the faith to believe it all.

And yet, each morning, the sun rises in the eastern sky - and each morning Eothas illuminates my simple plot of land, casting away the shadows of the unfaithful in His golden gaze. I thank thee, Eothas for all the springs I've had, and all that will come. I am in darkness, please bring me light.

      <DefaultText>When my students ask to be taught the way of Galawain, I tell them they have already failed. Does one ask a deer to present itself as dinner? Of course not - one must outwit, outmaneuver, and overpower the deer if one dreams of venison. So it is with the Seeker God - to ask a question is weakness and idle indecision, to seek answers is to understand, and to become one with Galawain. Survival begins with strength from within.

But I only strike my students when they ask the second stupid question, for all of us begin young and weak - it is a point fact, and not one of shame, and a central tenant to Galawain's teachings. Perseverance and cleverness are prized by Galawain above brute force - a fact my young pups often forget. It is right and proper that the strong lead the weak, and it is equally proper that the strong be continually tested until the balance changes. Galawain celebrates the strength of the victor and the prowess of the well-fed predator, but above all, the Clever Hound celebrates the transformative nature of strength. Galawain's greatest desire for us is that prey becomes predator, mewling babes grow into strong hunters, and the lost find their own enlightenment.

This philosophy is best exemplified by the rites of the anamfatha of Eir Glanfath. When one of the Glanfathan spiritual leaders is old and nearing death, it is customary to enter the woods and confront Galawain's herald. If the Seeker God finds that anamfath's life, deeds, and soul worthy, the reward is a quick death and his soul joins Galawain's pack. If deemed unworthy, the anamfath is killed, his soul forced to find its own way to the next life, and his memory erased from the records of the tribe - survival begins with strength from within, and weak leaders endanger the whole pack. This is Galawain at his purest: even at the end of life, one must struggle for worthiness, for greatness... just as one must struggle every day to feed his pack.

The Seeker God is easy to understand if one actively engages in the quest for knowledge, but his secrets are self-occluding to those who merely ask, desiring knowledge without the requisite hunt. My own flesh and blood once asked me, "Will learning to hunt please Galawain?" I told him yes but added, "Galawain would prefer that you hunt to learn."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Choice is a luxury we earn through peace. Struggle is our fundamental nature.

Even when our war banners sit idle, mankind foments strife - friends argue with fists, lovers kindle jealousies, merchants compete with lies... wherever mankind goes, struggle follows.

Magran is Goddess of fire and war, not bloodshed and conquest - though many in Readceras would tell it differently - how bitter they must be that Magran's priests were able to destroy a god made manifest... how bitter indeed. We who worship Magran are not addled barbarians or cloistered mystics. We are soldiers, armorers, watchmen, and bodyguards - artisans of conflict and protectors of our families and flags. We do not salivate for battle, we view war as unwelcome, but struggle is our fundamental nature. We do not pray for strife, we pray for the wisdom to resolve it quickly. We do not wish for war, but when it inevitably must be fought, we find divine ecstasy in discipline, efficiency, and excellence.

Magran, guide us to the battle that is just and fair - let us be your fire that burns away the profane, leaving only the righteous. If struggle is our fundamental nature, let victory be our inevitable state of grace!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>My mother lived every note of life's song - bringing me into this world was her last verse. For this, my father scorned me and abandoned me, and for this very same fact, my town's midwife and adherent of Hylea raised me as her own. When I came of age, I learned that Hylea visits us on the screams of women in childbirth - and when a woman dies giving life to her child, her soul is carried away and reborn as an avian attendant of Hylea's Court. Through the miracle of the Queen of Birds, my mother has been with me, watching over me my whole life.

I wear the fetish charms of the Cloudsinger - the bird I dreamt my mother became. My feathery trinkets look gaudy and unbecoming, but it is a signal fire to women in need that I am a trained midwife, blessed by Hylea and living every note of life's song. The Queen of Birds wills us to shepherd new life into the world, and not, as the other gods so often desire, to end it.

A follower of Magran once mocked my faith, saying I worshiped paintbrushes and birds - piddling things beneath the gods. I do not resent the other gods and the brutal necessities that they must oversee - but is not language, love, the arts, and creativity that which separates us from simple beasts? Hylea allows us to rise above our savage, feral selves. 

I am often amused that, upon seeing our holy aviaries, visitors frequently ask, "This is nice, but where is the REAL temple of Hylea?" Perhaps they think hallowed ground requires oppressive stoneworks and ceilings that hide the sky. They do not realize the Bird Queen stands not on ceremony, she makes herself manifest in the music of birds and in beauty of the ubiquitous open sky. 

Hylea prefers the worship of two children singing over a thousand petitioners silently praying for victory. The Sky-mother asks so little of us, and yet so much - we are charged to live every note of life's song... it surprises me how many fail to embrace this divine calling.

      <DefaultText>My Son,
Tomorrow I become The Effigy, tomorrow I become Skaen's embodiment on Eora, tomorrow my master chokes on his own whip.

For months, we met by secret conclave to plot our landlord's demise, all the while working the fields as if our hearts were content. Skaen teaches us to plot with the mind while keeping one's face impassive, inscrutable - fair fights are for those with armies. The Quiet Slave is our whetstone, our focus - in his worship, our cause finds focus, clarity, and possibility! Tomorrow, my master chokes on his own whip.

By the time you read this, I will be dead. I pray Skaen does not abandon me for speaking of my plotting, but a son deserves to know how his father died. For I have volunteered to be the Effigy - Skaen will inhabit my body, using this old farmer's simple flesh as a puppet of godly rage. I have been shaved and anointed - tomorrow morning, I will be your father in name only, as my manhood will be removed, my nose and ears removed, and my useless mortal eyes will be replaced with flint stones through which Skaen might see the world.

My son, I am sorry for the lies I have told you these past few seasons, but Skaen demands secrecy - even your mother knows nothing of my furtive service to The Quiet Slave. Curse my name if you must, but never weep for me, for I die for the betterment of our community, to smite our lord's corruption from the face of Eora! Tomorrow my master chokes on his own whip, for tomorrow, I become the Effigy!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dearest brother, or was it sister?

May this letter find you in well spirits. A man of thuggish bearing stormed into my library the other day and demanded I help him find a book on the construction of an arquebus.

 I thought it proper service to Wael to steer this man toward an illuminated manuscript on the subject of whittling toy soldiers and other miniature props. Unamused by my solution, I shrugged and said, "What is an answer without a question?" He did not find my spiritual rhetoric helpful or amusing, and so he punched out two of my teeth. I trust your summer has been less tumultuous than mine?

In more important news, my apprentice claims she saw the Eyeless Face in a dream the other night! I admit, I was so mad with envy that at first I refused to believe her... Wael forgive me for such a lapse of judgment.

She described an aumaua of brilliant blue hues with a featureless face surrounded by a swarm of eyes - no two eyes alike. She claims Wael ignored her questions, and she can't recall any specifics of what was said. In fact, my apprentice seems to have forgotten many things since before the visitation - she could not tell me where she grew up or what she liked to eat.

At first I was so envious of her for having seen Wael with her own eyes... but it seems Wael's visit was to conceal, not to illuminate... I pray she endures this test of faith and can look back at the event and feel the joy of mystery.

What is an answer without a question? Last week, I felt the solution was "ignorance," but after Wael's visit, I feel "a road without length" is closer to the capturing the riddle.

I worry my apprentice will look back at her visit from Wael and feel cheated - robbed of some moment of clarity we all thought we were owed when we first joined... I tried to tell her she was lucky but she was too young to understand. What is an answer without a question? May I be dead and my soul scattered to the winds before anyone knows for certain.

      <DefaultText>Your soldiers are not fully armed, or even decently dressed, without some basic knowledge of the Glanfathan language. If your scouts cannot eavesdrop, if our captured soldiers cannot recognize the words of their captors, or if our officers cannot answer a call to parlay - we fail. Knowing just a few simple facepainter words could mean the difference between tactical success and defeat in detail.

Glanfathan writing is, like Aedyran, adapted from the Old Vailian alphabet brought overseas by the Aedyrans long ago. The Glanfathans put their own spin on this alphabet, so there are some noticeable differences that can confuse the uninformed.

A and â is the difference between "paw" and "pat."
E and ê is the difference between "hen" and "hay."
I and î is the difference between "ilk" and "eel."
O and ô is the difference between "oats" and "ought."
W and ŵ is the difference between "butt" and "boot."

Note that last part - in Eir Glanfath, the letter w acts as our letter u - speaking with a consonant "www" sound is the perfect way to alert a Glanfathan to the fact that you're a Dyrwoodan struggling to learn the language. See "estramor" in the glossary below.

And keep in mind these tricky differences:

Dh is used for a hard thorn sound, such as with "this" or "that." Conversely, Th is a softer sound in Glanfathan - barely vocalized, like when one says "thief" or "thought."
Si sounds like a soft sh sound - like "ship." Put an accent on it and Sî sounds like "she" - you add an "h" sound in either case.

There's no replacement for actually learning Glanfathan by immersion, but to get you started, here are some important words that you and your soldiers should know:

Anam - soul
Anamfath, plural anamfatha - the spiritual leaders of the tribes.
Argŵes - armor (pronounced "Arg-oo-es")
Bewnen - life (pronounced "Be-uh-nen")
Blaidh - wolf (pronounced "Blay-th")
Cas - battle
Delem - leaf
Den - man
Enfath - princess
Estramor, plural Estramorwn - foreigner(s) (plural is "Es-tra-mor-un")
Fath, plural Fatha - prince(s)
Gwan - winter
Henwn - woman
I - in
Lle - place
Pames - walker
Rhemen - building
Rî, plural rîow - wise one(s) (singular is pronounced "Ree," plural is "Ree-au")
Scâth - shield
ŵen - maiden (pronounced "oo-en")
Weredh - soil (pronounced "ue-reth" with a hard th sound)
Weretha - the whole of our world (pronounced "ue-retha" with a soft th sound)</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sun does not set on the Aedyran language. Those of us who commune with this proud language, or some derivation of it, populate every corner of Eora.

Most of us who speak this wonderful tongue know it as Aedyran, but scholars and those obsessed with correctness often qualify it as 'modern' or 'contemporary' Aedyran. This is to contrast the language you and I speak today with Eld Aedyran - the old elven language that was spoken in the Aedyran Empire back before the pioneer settlers of the Dyrwood built their longships.

If Eld Aedyran could be considered the mother of the living Aedyran, the language of Hylspeak could be seen as Aedyran's cousin. Hylspeak is fading from common use but many of the elves (especially the older one) in the Aedyran heartland still use this dialect.

Whether you know it or not, if you can read these words, you can understand Hylspeak - it is almost identical to Aedyran but includes a large vocabulary of archaic words that have fallen out of use in today's Aedyran. When you hear bards sing old Aedyran poems, there are often lines of chorus that sound like melodic nonsense inserted to complete rhymes - these are usually instances of words that are lost from our common language but still used in Hylspeak.

While Hylspeak is familiar to speakers of so-called 'modern' Aedyran, the same cannot be said of our language's predecessor. Eld Aedyran is a dead language, spoken by academics but not used in any major community. Eld Aedyran words are often familiar to Aedyran readers, but the words use orthography that has since been abandoned - unfamiliar accents marks abound.

For example, Eld Aedyran contains some diphthongs that have no place in the modern Aedyran, as well as a few tricky consonant clusters:

Ea creates an "ey-ah" sound that sounds like the colloquial salutation "heya!"
Eo sounds like "ey-oh" - this sound is still used in the modern word "Eora."
Ey is pronounced as "ey-ee" such as in "wraith."
Ue and ü both create long "oo" sounds, as in "loop."
Y sounds like a "ee" sounds as in "bee."
Gj sounds like the consonant "y" as in "you."
Sc sounds like sh, so you'd pronounce scop like "shop."
Cg sounds like the "dge" end of a word like "hedge."

It is not uncommon for given names of Aedyrans, Dyrwoodans, and Readcerans to come from Eld Aedyran. Some examples:

Aldwyn is pronounced "ALD-ween" because of the long vowel sound on the y.
Durnisc is pronounced "DUR-nish" since the final Sc cluster sounds like an Sh sound.
Gjestr is pronounced "YES-tr" on account of the Gj consonant cluster.
Slecg is pronounced like "Sledge."
Thyrsc is pronounced "THEER-sh."
Uscgrim is "OOSH-grim" and not "usk-grim"
Yngmar is pronounced "EENG-mar," leading with a vowel sound.</DefaultText>

"Anni Iroccio: The New Year

While only 150 years old (and of Vailian origin as well), the Iroccian calendar is currently used throughout most of the Dyrwood and the surrounding areas. While the Dyrwood was using the Aedyran calendar until recently, they gave it up in favor of the Iroccian calendar. The transition was easy to get people to make because the Aedyran calendar was hopelessly inaccurate.

Iroccio calculated that it takes the planet approximately 334 days to orbit the sun, so he took the nine months from the Aedyran calendar and broke them into sixteen months of twenty days each, with each season consisting of four months. The length of each month corresponds to how long it takes Belafa (one of our moons) to circle the planet. At the end of each season, three days - not part of either season - are set aside for people to celebrate the transitions. Lastly, the final two days of the year - New Year and Mid Year - are used to observe the beginning and midpoint of the year.

To prevent any confusion for the transition from the old calendar to the new, Iroccio kept the year the same. So, although the calendar has only been in existence for 150 years, it is currently 2823 AI (Anni Iroccio).

Iroccio gave the months Vailian names, but in the Dyrwood and surrounding areas, they call them by their translated names.

The year is broken down in the following way -

New Year - A day to celebrate the arrival of the new year. Of all the holidays, this one is celebrated by most people around the Dyrwood and the Vailian Republics. Each new year is greeted with a fervent zeal to begin things anew and start with a fresh slate.

Winter Months (Two at the beginning of the year and two at the end)

Deep Winter - Fonivèrno 
Late Winter - Tarivèrno 

Spring Dawn (3 days) - Inprima - Used to celebrate the transition of the world, rebirth, and Spring. Eothasian festivals are especially prevalent at this time, or were, prior to the Saint’s War. 
 
Spring Months

Early Spring - Préprima
Mid Spring - Majprima
Deep Spring - Fonprima
Late Spring - Tarprima

Summer Rising (3 days) - Inestu - A period of transition from birth to growth. Many ceremonies designed to usher children into adulthood take place during Summer Rising.

Summer Months (and Mid Year)

Early Summer - Préëstu
Mid Summer - Majestu

Mid Year - A day of reflection and introspection. The year is half over. People who made promises on New Year use Mid Year to assess their progress and renew their oaths.

Deep Summer - Fonestu
Late Summer - Tarestu

Autumn Falling (3 days) - Inauton - Harvest celebrations happen during Autumn Falling if the crops were particularly bountiful. If the harvest was small, supplication is given to the gods asking for a better harvest the following year.

Autumn Months

Early Autumn - Préauton
Mid Autumn - Majauton
Deep Autumn - Fonauton
Late Autumn - Tarauton

Winter Dusk (3 days) - Inivèrno (ihn-ih-VEHR-no) - Winter Dusk is filled with celebrations of life and vigils for the dead. The world is returning to sleep, plants die, and those still alive raise a toast to another year.

Winter Months

Early Winter - Préïvèrno (pree-ih-VEHR-no)
Mid Winter - Majivèrno (mahzh-ih-VEHR-no)"

    <Entry>
      <ID>2365</ID>
      <DefaultText>These pages have been torn out of a larger book. They are stained brown and stiff with some dark, fragrant liquid. The entries begin thus:

"I wanted so badly to find Poko Kohara, and now we are stuck here. No one dares to leave while the titan roams outside, so we must hope we can find another exit somewhere in the ruins. Olara must have triggered it - it did not move until she began prying open the door, and before we knew it, it had Gian. The others do not say it, but I know they blame me for failing to save him."

Smudges of dirt from the author's hand streak the page around the next entry.

"Olara is gone, too. We move more slowly now, wary of traps and monsters. I detest this creeping about, and Dueno's stomping nearly makes it all pointless. But Falero has almost lost his nerve, and I do not think he can take another nasty surprise."

The next entry is filled with big, crooked letters that loop and swoop like a child's.

"The other sleep. We decided against candles or campfires, so I write in the glow of the adra. It is good, because I hear something moving in the dark, even if the others do not.

Falero insisted that we move slowly so he could study the murals and the patterns in the floor. He thinks to save us from mishaps like the ones that befell Gian and Olara, but none of that will help if the creatures here catch us. Dueno hides a limp, but the way he looks at Falero and me makes me think he is hiding something else, too.

They grow more and more paranoid with every hour in this place. When they awaken, we will press forward so that we may be done with it.

In the meantime, I will keep the pages with my own observations. I cannot trust the others with them."

The next entry is hastily scribbled.

"Falero lost the logbook and accuses me of sabotage. Sabotage!

He is so busy sketching these murals that he forgets why we are here. But I saw the adra and I understood - this place is sick. We are here to cure it.

But Falero says the Huana were here long ago - that the murals prove as much. I think one aumaua looks much like another, but he gave me an idea.

Right now, we spend blood and treasure searching for luminous adra. Our task would be much easier if we could make regular adra luminous by enriching it with live souls. 

As I look at the equipment the Engwithans built here - so like the machines our animancers construct - I wonder if they once did this very thing.

And we have the villagers of Tikawara, so eager to help!

When we return to Neketaka, I will present my idea to Lueva Alvari. I do not think Director Castol has the stomach for it. Nor my companions, I fear."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This leather-bound logbook has "Property of the Vailian Trading Company" stamped inside its cover. Most of the pages are dark brown and stiff, stained with some dark, aromatic beverage.

A few pages have been ripped from the end.

"We set out at dawn on orders from Governor Alvari. She's heard rumor of luminous adra at a place called Poko Kohara. Unfortunately, the place is said to be surrounded by storms, and it doesn't appear on any of our charts, but we're told the locals at Tikawara may be able to help.

20 Préauton
I'd heard stories of bad run-ins with Huana tribes, but Chieftain Ruānu and the tribe at Tikawara welcomed us warmly. Fed us as well as could be expected and marked Poko Kohara on our maps. He seems to believe the storms are magical, or else the will of the gods. I hold out hope that they can be stopped.

2 Majauton
Left for Poko Kohara this morning. Vektor wasn't happy about being left behind, but he was too sick to travel and Beza was losing patience. Haven't seen a Rauataian ship since we left Neketaka, but she's still afraid they'll beat us there.

5 Majauton
Storms were some of the worst I've seen, but we made it. We set up camp by the cliffs, but we're all looking forward to getting into the ruins. At least it'll be dry in there.

7 Majauton
We lost Gian and Olara today. I don't know what, but something about this place seems off. The others feel it, too.

? Majauton
The murals here are incredible - proof that the Engwithans met ancient Huana two thousand years ago! That they might have even built this place! I keep trying to explain this to Beza, but she won't listen.

? Majauton
We found the top of the adra vein. It is glowing, but Beza says we have to go deeper."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This stone tablet is much eroded after years of neglect, but the elegant Huana runes decorating its surface have endured for untold millennia:

"Though god-stricken skies and mile-high waves tossed my ship, my mind's compass never wavered from dear Ukaizo.
When a splintered mast - such traitorous lumber - hit me across the brow, I was knocked into a vision of pearlescent shores.
I awoke on black-watered seas of terrible calm, with no two stars paired in a familiar form. 
Paddling my wreck with makeshift oars, I came at last upon an isle where each neighbor spoke a different tongue. 
For all that I sailed in the years after, never again would my spyglass take in the peaks of wondrous Ukaizo.
I sat up in bed, then of an age when the tears came unbidden, pondering where sleep had ended and dreams began.
Rising to meet the sun, I found it still to be night, though a false glow ignited the shapely sky. 
An azure beacon stood up from the horizon, and familiar anthems filled my ears.
It was then I spotted a ship, a lively crew of youths, setting sail for their horizon - a frontier that had once been mine.
To those shores I was a departing echo, but someone would find them again. Someone worthy to alight on the sands of lost Ukaizo."</DefaultText>

Spyglasses allow you to view objects from land while on your ship while also providing special options during many encounters in the world.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Most of this document is drafted in a careful, official hand. Another author appears to have made several hasty additions.

"To our valued customer,

On behalf of the dedicated staff of the Consignment and Salvage Clearinghouse, we thank you for expressing interest in the purchase of (1 mail vest, enchantments unknown, previous owner Magnera Freetrader).

Unfortunately, our licensed dealer, (Rimo Caldera, salvage marker 56221), informed us (item unavailable, delivery to be carried out by Captain Henqua but shipment interdicted by pirate hunters, vessel sunk). This is most regrettable.

Enclosed is your original payment of (Vailian trade bullion, amount undisclosed, minus ten percent finder's fee). We certainly hope you will consider future business with us, despite this setback.

Sincerest regards,
Rowen Gjakon, shipping quartermaster, CaSC

Dealer notes, if any:
(not certain if vest went down with Henqua. &lt;xg&gt;Will&lt;/xg&gt; make further inquiries.)"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This ledger is a record of luminous adra shipments back to the Vailian Republics.

Swift Jackal - 1 ton, 500,000 lusce
Bound for Spirento - paid in full.

Feathered Witch - 1 ton, 500,000 lusce
Bound for Ozia - paid in full

Vengiatta - .5 tons, 240,000 lusce
Bound for Ancenze - mutiny, lost.

Lady's Promise - .75 tons, 440,000 lusce
Bound for Ozia and Revua - lost, raided?

Ondra's Knife - 1.2 tons, 510,000 lusce
Bound for Spirento - intercepted.

There is a note in the margins from one of Ezzali's clerks: 

My lady, this trend cannot have escaped your notice. Our superiors grow agitated by the volume of product that ends up in Príncipi holds. There are too many pirates, and too many dissatisfied captains, to send out volleys of lighter cargo as you suggested. Your orders on how to proceed? 

I have also made note of several inconsistencies - areas where my predecessor skewed the math to benefit an outside party. Pages are also missing, which leads me to believe you have been robbed. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Atello, 

I do not write on behalf of the other captains of your illustrious fleet, but I hope that you understand my voice is still theirs - even if they are too proud to air a grievance. You and I have known each other too long to hide our thoughts from one another. 

I know that money is tight, and that you cannot spend what you do not have. But the Royal Deadfire incursion and the boldness of the Príncipi have not made the waters between the Republics and Deadfire any calmer. 

Our ships are battered and bruised - nearly unrecognizable, as they are patched with the flotsam of our defeated foes. We make do with what little we have, but this is an exhausting and hopeless way of life. 

Send us the coin to make formal repairs, or else we will abandon ship - and the next vessel I captain will not bear our family's sigil. 

Please, brother.

Periki's Devotion

Pitied is Ngati, Lady of Lament.

As the pearl orb of the heavens crosses her view,

Her eyes well with tears as constant as rain.

But the moon's skyward journey continues apace,

The lovers' affection as ephemeral as fingers touching.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>2682</ID>
      <DefaultText>A timeworn adage among practitioners of the arcane arts avers that early wizards compelled imps to service not out of a desire for the assistance, but to banish them from underfoot. I doubt it not at all, for one could not conjure more unruly, noisome, maladroit, or irascible aid. Why then, do we employ these diminutive meddlers?

Imps, dear reader, are to a wizard's sanctum as rats are to a ship. Whether out of malign instinct or pure mischievousness, they infiltrate our laboratories with alarming regularity. Ninagauth conjectures in his Sensitivity of Simpletons that imps infest any locus of concentrated mystical influence, and accounts of the creatures lurking among the uninhabited ruins of Engwith seem to corroborate his supposition. Yet a wizard's domicile seems to possess a particular appeal to them, regardless of whether it resides at a nexus of spiritual power or no.

Left to their own devices, the winged miscreants accrue loose baubles, hording them in filthy dens as often as not established in our cupboards and privies. Seemingly possessed of an antiquity dealer's discernment, each prefers to pilfer the most valuable paraphernalia and potent artifacts, yet they remain pathetically inept in the use of even the simplest gewgaw.

I admit the imp's general incompetence makes them appealing retainers. One of the little cretins may displace a favored wand of elemental power, but little peril exists of it activating the instrument and immolating your collected volumes of arcana. 

The same cannot be said of apprentices.

Yet the beasts present a danger to the unwary, for they possess a low cunning not unlike that of xaurips and orlans. Without a domineering hand to direct them, imps rapidly regress to their base instincts. As a result of their propensity for pack behavior, even transitory leniency with a single imp can imperil a wizard's entire collection.

      <DefaultText>The misery of this apprenticeship... madiccho. Arkemyr saves only the most tedious errands for me. If I'm not going to learn anything from this trial, I must find some way to steal enjoyment from it. 

Whenever Arkemyr claims to be "deep in study" I will find him wandering the halls wearing an illusory face to trick his imps. Fools them every time. Sometimes I think he came to the Deadfire to be alone with those nasty things, and he spites me for getting in the way of his fun.

Shortly after he left town, I stole one the robes he keeps in his bedroom. The imps thought I was their master. Fed me cheese and ale for the rest of the afternoon. Of course I returned the robe when I was done. Ac, maybe it's not too late to start enjoying myself.</DefaultText>

Legend tells that this was once the staff of a nāga tribe who used it to pay ritualistic obeisance to their incarnate deity, the Deep Hunter. Their patron bestowed favor and plenty upon the tribe in exchange for unwavering fealty.

The rod later fell into the hands of Periki, a whaler and future founder of the Watershapers Guild. She used the rod to empower her students with a deeper understanding of the Huana ancestral art. It represents a longstanding covenant, though its purpose has evolved over time.</DefaultText>

This is a court crown, intended to be worn day-to-day, unlike some of the queen's more extravagant diplomatic wear. The crown's feathers identify it as the Serpent Crown, which the queen bore as a symbol of her authority as well as a subtle criticism of the various foreigners, rivals, and competing interests that recently beset her palace. According to Huana tradition, a monarch wears the Serpent Crown when she is surrounded by untrustworthy snakes. The symbolism was not lost on the queen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>What follows is an initiate's primer in the Four Forms of watershaping, which comprise the basic lessons of our guild: Grief, Hope, Metamorphosis, and Transcendence.

The Form of Grief - Acceptance that one's physicality is not as mutable as water.

The Form of Hope - Understanding that water is more relentless and inexorable than any natural force.

The Form of Metamorphosis - Realization that the body's internal water can help to mediate the prior forms. 

The Form of Transcendence - Water covers Eora. If water can be shaped, so can the world. </DefaultText>

As blood seeps from a wound so deep, an death croons about this sepulcher,

Let silence fall in final wardin to betake my priest intil Berath's dark maw,

After many a battle, when my mace had failt him. Now a bind his wounds, 

An can watch only, while he dies.

      <DefaultText>This gnarled staff is heavier than it looks, owing to the entwined length of amber and adra running down its core. Story goes that this was originally the backbone of an ancient adragan, who - upon noting the advance of outsiders into her forest - sacrificed herself to preserve its health. Many have claimed to possess shards of her petrified remains, and this is hardly the first spine to boast that distinction. Regardless of its origin, this length of wood possesses an uncanny echo of dormant power. </DefaultText>

"Kō-

You know I've never been one for superstition, but I'm telling you, there's something to these dreams. Couldn't tell you what they mean. Only that they wake me three times a night.

All of us working your farms - pious Eothasians to a man - are having them, too. 

I've got no mind to tell you how to run your fort, but I've got to look after my brethren here. We left homes and families back in Readceras. And now we're seeing strange things and laboring next to a duc's ransom in black powder. 

Or did you reckon a dumb hick like me wouldn't notice?

It's all arranged. So long as your captain sticks to her route, our ship will meet yours at sea three days hence. Don't forget to dump your powder before we arrive - every cannonball that strikes our hull will be one less limb we leave you with, understand? And be sure to wear a red bandanna so we don't kill you by accident.

If all goes as planned, a spot on our ship and a fair share of the plunder will be yours, as promised.

      <DefaultText>Obsidian occurs naturally throughout the Deadfire due to the regions high volcanic activity. Though it is brittle, obsidian can be knapped to create an incredibly sharp edge. Huana use the material for various cutting instruments, including knives and spear points. When Huana come across large chunks of obsidian suitable for knapping, they break them into spalls and flakes for trade or personal use.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The hon is an odd-looking half-coin, created from a bronze ōa by simply breaking it in half along a deep groove in the casting. The hon was created during a period of Rauatai's history when the ranga nui did not want to create any more currencies. Instead, he had the royal mint modify the existing dies to include a depression in the casting.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though quite rare in the present day, old bronze ōas continue to circulate in Rauatai and among their trading partners. The only difference between an old ōa and a new ōa is that the former lacks the casting depression that allows the coin to be broken into two bronze hons of equal value. Because of their rarity and slightly higher bronze content, the old ōas are a little more valuable. Younger Rauataians sometimes jokingly refer to "grandpa's ōa" as a symbol of an earlier time before the kingdom's rapid expansion and militarization.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This battle axe was carried by a warrior of the Forged in Fire, a militant Magranite warband, and saw service during the Saint's War. Purportedly it was crafted by Rufus Aechmont, the sect's most venerable weaponsmith. While the weapon was still glowing red from the forge, Rufus is said to have begged Magran to bless the weapon and its creator. When Rufus quenched the weapon, the oil ignited, badly injuring Rufus and burning his smithy to the ground. While later searching the rubble, Rufus claimed to have recovered the axe head, still red-hot. The blade never cooled, a sure sign of Magran's favor.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Taeral Tyrind, dwarf captain of the Vailian privateer carrack Furiato Vielo, learned well the deadly business of deck-to-deck combat over his long years of violent plunder. The blunderbuss, his boarding crew's favored weapon, was well suited to the task of sweeping an enemy deck of opponents - but reloading such a weapon was damnably slow in the heat of combat. Taeral, a capable gunsmith, set forth to improve his own weapon. 

He needed a firearm that could be loaded quickly. It had to be able to, in his words, "fire anything, even the godsdamned kitchen stove." In that endeavor, he was successful. The gun he crafted could accommodate just about any type of ammunition so long as it fit down the trumpet-like barrel. Taeral was known to load nails, forks, and even coins into the gun. In a particularly grisly recollection, after suffering a near fatal gunshot wound to the face, he is said to have rammed a handful of his own broken teeth into the trusty weapon before shooting his attacker dead.

Taeral, aged, scarred, and battle-weary, eventually retired. Ill-suited to a life ashore, he fell on hard times and was forced to pawn the weapon that had saved his life many times over. Both he and the weapon faded into obscurity.

      <DefaultText>This fearsome blade was forged by an animancer whose name has been lost to time. The writings she left, however, give her contemporaries a glimpse into her motivations. The animancer, by her own words, was terrified for the fate of her soul, and dreaded the idea of her essence being ground into the Wheel and returned to the world. To forestall what she saw as her ultimate demise, she created a black, skein steel great sword with which to harvest the soul energies of others, invigorating her life essence. The blade, however, exacted a toll on its creator, leading to her inevitable death. While powerful, it demands the life force of those who wield it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When a temple acolyte from Dyrford decided to leave behind his life of prayer and meditation in exchange for adventure, he carried a simple hatchet as he marched for Stalwart Village. Unfortunately, the acolyte's cloistered life had done little to prepare him for surviving in the wild. Halfway to Stalwart he was caught in an unseasonably bitter snowstorm. As night fell, the storm turned into the coldest blizzard the region had ever recorded.

The acolyte's body was found frozen stiff the next morning. He stood, hatchet in one hand, while the other held up his collar as if to protect his face from the wind. The hatchet, now permanently covered in a layer of frost, houses a portion of his wayward soul.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Engwithan woodcutter who carried this bronze-headed hatchet was likely a tradesman rather than a warrior, though he undoubtedly faced countless dangers in the ancient woods where he earned his living. Lurkers and forest sprites would have seen an unarmed woodcutter as easy prey, so the hatchet served both as a tool and weapon for defense. The axe is well-suited to lumbering. The runes stamped into the head are a bane to all plants. Vines and branches retreat from its presence, and a single stroke is enough to split timber.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aamiina of the Blue Water tribe, daughter of the revered Ajamuut, carried on her mother’s duties after the death of the matron huntress. To secure her status as the successor of her foremother, Aamiina enrolled in the challenge of Ongitok Angunisaq. Far from a game, this trial pitted the young dwarf against all the dangers of Naasitaq. She spent three weeks in the wild, battling endless blizzards and voracious beasts. Her bow was her only means defense and subsistence.

Her trial complete, Aamiina was trekking for home when she happened across a hungry frost drake stalking towards Blue Water village, using the storm to hide its approach. With no consideration for her own safety, Aamiina raised her horn and trumpeted a warning to the Blue Water warriors, who mobilized in time to fend off the beast.

Denied its prize, the fearsome drake turned on Aamiina. The young huntress nocked and loosed, slaying the drake with a single arrow to the heart. Her bold actions secured her place among the matron huntresses that came before her.</DefaultText>

They are a lineage known not only for their great wealth, but also the opulent way they parade it.

      <DefaultText>The people of Midwood had long told tales of the aggressive wildlife that inhabited the forest. When woodsmen and hunters began to come under frequent attack by animals near the villages, a master huntsman was elected to investigate. The one consistency in the accounts of the attacks was the presence of a giant, white stag. The huntsman set out to locate and fell the creature, hoping it would end the assaults.

After a month in woods, the huntsman emerged. He was near death, bleeding from multiple wounds. He was badly broken as well, as though trampled by a great beast. In his hands he carried a freshly-fashioned pike made of antlers. He died before reaching the village and told no tales of the hunt before breathing his last. However, after his passing the attacks in the forest ceased completely.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vincolo Scordeo acquired this ivory-furnished pistol from the second captain he ever led a mutiny against. Leading mutinies was, in fact, one of Scordeo's few talents. He was a mediocre sailor and a poor pirate - mostly because of his acute distaste for following orders - but he was an excellent turncoat. The mutiny went off without a hitch. Scordeo disarmed the captain and shot him in the head. That accomplished, Scordeo took command. 

His brief stint as captain was cut short by a second mutiny soon after, however, and he found himself marooned on a small atoll. His treacherous shipmates had been kind enough to leave him the clothes on his back, his new pistol, and half a bottle of rum. Unwilling to pull the trigger on himself, Scordeo drank the rum and waited to die.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This unusual rapier was once carried by a widely-feared captain of the Príncipi known for his ruthlessness and his ability to evade the most determined pirate hunters. Azio "Calmo" (Squid) was a man of cruel humor and dogged determination. The captain of the red-sailed sloop Cirono's Mercy, his own crew feared him as much as his foes. He survived four mutiny attempts, each time miraculously reversing the circumstances of an ambush. Legends spread of the wicked pirate captain with eyes in the back of his head and a rapier the color of ink.
When travelers saw a Príncipi flag, they breathed sighs of relief when the ship attached to it was not Azio's. Though the other captains of the Príncipi wanted to reprimand the Squid for his excessive cruelty, they, too, feared his wrath.
One of the Príncipi captains, Bernetta, eventually set sail with her ship, Wave-Breaker, to parley with Azio and pass on the concerns of the others. Days later, another Príncipi ship found the Wave-Breaker abandoned - save for a box containing Bernetta's severed head and the suolenets of the crew.
Though Azio had escaped the pirate hunters for years, it was the murder of Bernetta that turned the Príncipi against him. Within weeks, hunters had sacked many of Azio's secret hideouts and plundered his reserves. The Príncipi who caught sight of Cirono's Mercy avoided the ship and their ports provided him no shelter.
Eventually he was set upon by the Vailian caravel Pliambo Pumo and the Rauataian gunship Black Reef near the Mala Kumo tribe's village. The captain of the Pliambo Pumo, Cisensa, ordered her men to board and led the Vailian charge. Azio's crew, sensing that this would finally be the end of their cruel captain, were quick to surrender. Meanwhile, Azio had leapt into the shallow waters near the Mala Kumo village and frantically swam to shore. Unfortunately for Azio, tales of his wickedness had reached even this small circle of Huana. Before the tribe's Mataru closed in, the Mala Kumo's Storm Speakers pummeled Azio with magic. Staggered by the onslaught, the pirate was unable to draw his rapier and the Mataru quickly overpowered him.
Each group that aided in Azio's defeat tells a different story about his demise. The Vailians say he was handed over to his crew, who stomped him to death on the deck of Cirono's Mercy. The Rauataians say he was lashed to the mouth of a cannon on the Black Reef and blown to pieces. Mala Kumo elders say that the Mataru carried him into the deep water for Ngati to drag into her bosom.
What is known for certain is that Cisensa successfully bartered with the Mala Kumo for Azio's distinctive black steel rapier. When the Pliambo Pumo went missing in 2171 AI, it was assumed that Azio's rapier was lost forever. It reappeared in a Huana market in 2173 AI and has been circling the Deadfire ever since. Rumors claim that each bearer is cursed to die within a year of holding it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Responsibility for the Great Histories of Rauatai falls to the most trusted chanters of the lore college. This scrimshaw wand was the personal implement of the venerable chanter skald, Kaliwi the Storyteller. As a wandering lore keeper, Kaliwi traveled the islands of the Kingdom spreading tales of great heroes. 

Kaliwi used this wand not only as a tool of defense from the ever-present dangers of the Deadfire, but to enhance her stories with vivid imagery, colors, and sounds - a technique she called "weaving." She was especially fond of weaving her stories for children. To Kaliwi, the mind of a child was eager to believe in the unbelievable and find comfort in the fantastical. The greatest stories, after all, need not have necessarily happened to be true.

A bit of illusory magic persists in the wand. When held, it whispers of tall tales, dazzling deeds, and the altogether extraordinary.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fleetbreaker Castle, also known as Daghan's Spire, was once known for its corps of crossbow defenders - the Boghadir. These elite guards were renowned for their deadly accuracy and carried powerful steel crossbows such as this. The Boghadir battle doctrine was twofold. First, any invading force would first come under fire by designated marksmen at range. These marksmen, firing at will, were to diminish and demoralize the attackers. Second - when their enemies closed distance to the walls of the keep, Boghadir point-defenders would then hit them with relentless, coordinated mass-fire, one line after another. If the attackers were repulsed and fell back, they would once again fall under fire from the sharpshooters. At no point was the enemy to have any respite from a steady rain of crossbow bolts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>9 Majestu, 2816 AI - I've finally found it, the burial site of Paira, a leader of the ancient Huana. What little knowledge still remains of her says that she was a skilled engineer. It should be fascinating to see if any of her work was buried with her.     10 Majestu - Damn. I should've known better. Just getting here was bad enough, but it looks as though her burial site was crafted to make sure no one disturbs her. I've already lost three of my companions, and another other took off in the night. Scared off, I guess. I'm on my own. Paira was good, if she designed these traps... but no one would build something like this without a backdoor, or a way to turn them off. I'll just keep looking.     11 Majestu - Something from an old story came back to me during the night, "shaking hands with the gods". Well, there are no gods in here, just a room filled with some kind of noxious gas.     12 Majestu - Scrap of parchment, crumbled away in my hands. Was barely able to make out a single sentence, "Rikuhu is the beginning. Rikuhu is the end."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>3 Inauton, 2827 AI
I have found this water-stained notebook at the bottom of my satchel, and now, having no use for it, I must record my thoughts, or I fear I will go mad in the solitary confinement of my own head. 

Months have passed, and still we are stranded on this cursed island. What few supplies we had with us at the time of our calamity have dwindled away to little more than dust and crumbs. When it became clear that we would be trapped on this island for some time, we began to ration our food. It was half-rations at first, but as the days wore on and help became ever less a possibility and ever more a dream, we took only one meal a day, then one meal every two days.

Fresh water, at least, is plentiful. It bubbles up from a crack in the stone near the ruins. No doubt it is pushed to the surface by some unseen force of vulcanism. I should have liked to have had my instruments on hand to record its rate of flow and volume, but those are long since gone, likely resting at the bottom of the sea.

Our numbers shrink day by cursed day. Always now my clothes smell of rancid meat, of sweat and smoke. The jerky we made from Caral's thigh has gone off. We had thought he might survive the amputation, but he passed away in the night two days ago from a fever in his blood.


16 Préauton, 2827 AI
We have better learned how to cure our meat, but our blades have gone dull, and we have only sea water with which to cleanse them. None have survived an amputation since Caral's tragic passing, so we no longer bother with the practice. More's the pity - I was becoming an old hand at it.

Elewys was lost to us today. It pains me to write the words, though her passing comes as no surprise. She drew the shortest reed.

Her necklace I intended to keep, but it has gone missing since her death. I'd always thought it suited her, that the stone matched the light in her eyes. I wanted to remember that light.

Perhaps someone is hiding it, though I do not know why they would do me such an unkindness. I was meant to have it. She never said as much, but I know. I will perform a search of the others' belongings when next I have the midnight watch. Woe betide the thief.


13 Majauton, 2827 AI
A chill wind has found us. It blows ceaselessly across the isle, whipping our shelters into disarray and peppering our meals with sand. We take shelter in the nearby ruins, though I am loath to do it. Always that place has seemed to me befouled by some unfriendly spirit, for I hear whispers when the wind blows. They cry for mercy, for salvation.

Another of the crew has disappeared this morning. Some suspect he tied stones to his wrists and walked himself into the sea. But they are wrong. I saw him walk while he was dreaming, with jerky movements not his own. He wandered deep into the ruins and did not return.


20 Majauton, 2827 AI
So few of us remain. I envy them, the departed - their souls are returned to the Wheel and free to find new lives to lead. We unlucky few receive no such boon. And that is what we have given them - a gift. We suffer so that they might be free.

Arlendr says we might fashion a raft large enough to escape this place. He is mad. We belong to this isle now, as it belongs to us.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>2 Fonivèrno, 2827
The new year is come. The time for reflection, beginnings and endings. 

Here I am, an aged man of sixty years retired from the services of the Steel Garrote. I have no family of which to speak. No tethers bind me to this life but those that bind me to my brothers in the order.

In the tradition of the new year, I wonder - will I spend my twilight years in swift decline, waiting only to feel the Pallid Knight's touch upon my cheek?

No. For decades, veterans of the Garrote have traded tales of a legendary mace said to be blessed by Woedica herself. What I would give to behold but one thing touched by the hands of the Exiled Queen!

I will embark on my final quest. I will gather my brothers, find the mace, and with it - a pride that will buoy me to the end my days.

So be it.


1 Inprima, 2827
Long we have journeyed, my brothers and I. I begin to wonder now if this was a fool's errand, an old man's last grasp at the glory of boyhood tales.

We left Aedyr in good spirits on a boat bound for the Deadfire. Our good cheer has fled, yet still we are on this cursed boat.

Were the legends a lie? Cud for old soldiers to chew, fodder for talk of "remember when" and "the good old days"?

I wake in the night thinking I have heard the sound of Wymarc's familiar drunken stumble into the barracks, but it is only the groan of the ship or a deck door swung open and slamming in the wind.

I &lt;xg&gt;miss&lt;/xg&gt; the comforts of the Garrote's lair. A roaring fire, strong beer, a tale or two among friends. &lt;xg&gt;Will&lt;/xg&gt; I ever know those comforts again?


17 Majestu, 2827
The tide has turned in our favor!

Ulfric muscled a tip from a skittish fisherboy in port. There is an ancient shrine on a nearby island, the boy said, and none from his town will venture within a hundred yards of it.

Expecting little more than a benighted ruin, we dropped anchor just off its coast and rowed ashore. And what should we find but a shrine dedicated to the Queen That Was and her mace of legend!

The mace itself is exquisite, a marvel of craftsmanship. It will look magnificent above the mantle in the Garrote's hideaway. Ah, how my eyes burn to imagine the tales they will tell of us.

We have decided to rest here for the night and feast on our remaining hard tack and jerky. Tomorrow, we begin our journey home.

Surely Woedica herself guides our path.


18 Majestu, 2827
I cannot remember the last time I have slept so well. Not on the boat, not in the barracks, not even in my own bed as a boy.

Perhaps it is the presence of the shrine that soothes me. Indeed, these past few hours I have known only the peace a man might find in communion with his god.

My brothers and I have decided to remain here for another night. We are old, and we are weary, and we all find comfort in the presence of the Exiled Queen.

This is a safe place. Certainly we will find no trouble here.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wrought of fine steel and engraved with gilded Eld Aedyran runes that read MODWYR, this blade would have been a fashionable Dyrwoodan noble's favored accessory twenty years ago. Time has been rather unkind to it, however. The delicate filigree relief in its pommel has been scored by accident and violence, and the tightly wound leather of its hilt is stained with patches of old blood. For all that, the blade itself is sharp and curiously warm to the touch, and the tongue of the soul inside it is sharper still.

Where it's from and who might have forged it are mysteries the sword has little interest in illuminating, though it does speak with a lively Dyrwoodan twang - a fact that tells you more about its origins than it has any intention of doing itself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aruihi,

A swell of hateful intentions winds its way up to Serpent's Crown. The long stalemate with our 'allies' comes to an abrupt end. 

You anticipated this day. I merely wished to forestall it. I apologize if I ever underestimated your judgment. In better times, we would have done greater things for the tribes, but tricksome Ngati had other plans. 

Fight well, brother of mine. My personal guard will fortify the rooftop. They are poised to take me far away from our city if your forces are overwhelmed. Our enemies will not find me until the moment of my choosing. 

Should you fall through Tangaloa's mouth, may the wisdom of this life carry you to the next. We will return to serve the tribes again. 

Your sister and queen,
Onekaza II</DefaultText>

      <ID>3473</ID>
      <DefaultText>Excerpted from &lt;i&gt;The Legends of Eora&lt;/i&gt; by Amaia, scholar of Rauatai.

"In all my travels among the islands of the Deadfire Archipelago, I have heard tell of no cult so feared as the Sanguine Harvest.

All that is known of them is hearsay and rumor. Based on this, I would be inclined to conclude that the Sanguine Harvest are little more than a story. But how is one to explain the disappearances of innocent kith around the 16th of the month?

What may have befallen these poor souls is dismal indeed. Those few I spoke to who claimed knowledge of the Sanguine Harvest would swear to me only that they received it secondhand, and they had this to say:

On the 16th of every month, the Sanguine Harvest choose one unlucky captive to kneel before their altar and become fodder for a cabal of fampyrs. Through this act, the leader, or 'Grand Harvester,' empowers a fearful, soul-draining greatsword. To what end the Grand Harvester then puts this sword is unknown.

The cult members, or 'Harvest Cantors,' then dance around a fire in a state of mindless, ecstatic joy.

They clothe themselves in robes of black edged in red, and on their robes is the image of a large dagger cutting three kith in half.

It sounds too ridiculous to believe, does it not? And yet, I wonder."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The product of a wizard who considered himself an engineer, this arbalest has been modified to fire larger, thicker bolts. This provided no shortage of obstacles in its initial construction. The wizard found he need to strengthen the bow lathes to accommodate the oversized bolts. Thus, a heavier string was required. As a result, the retaining nut had to be reinforced. Even a customized, enchanted windlass was needed to span the blasted thing. The stock itself was initially too weak for the whole operation and the wizard, ever a pragmatist, found structural enchantments were required to keep the weapon from snapping in two once armed. 

Runes etched into the massive, spearlike bolts helped them fly true and gave them the punch to puncture steel and flesh. However, the wizard found it took considerable expenditures of his own arcane powers to make them do so. In the end, the weapon, while powerful, seemed only of use to those with sufficient knowledge of arcana. As such, the wizard abandoned his plans to produce similar weapons en masse and kept this prototype for his personal use.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>To create a draught of greater strength,
a blend of flame and ruby make.

For one who seeks vitality,
a mix of stone and pearl they need.

To grant oneself a careful step,
a brew of wind and emerald prep.

If cleverness one lacks in spades,
for flame and sapphire one needs must trade.

For those few cursed with lesser vision,
adra bán and wind provision.

And to be blessed with purpose or intention,
grind stone and amber in succession.

Into each elixir enjoin we must 
the inclusion of a shining dust,
a hearty smear of spirit essence,
and water of a pure quintessence.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This journal details the wizard Bekarna's studies of the night sky. She built an observatory and crafted specialized instruments to research her theory that some arcane energies originate from incredibly remote sources - perhaps even the stars themselves. 

Her final entry reads:

"The stars are either dead zones or my instruments lack refinement. Shouting over their energy signature is a &lt;xg&gt;concentration&lt;/xg&gt; of soul essence moving through the Deadfire - enough to justifiably be called a river. Oddly, it seems to pick up speed where it veers off to the northeast, as if drawn into a whirlpool. What is this region hiding that can exert such a tug on reincarnation itself? Bekarna, you are in way over your head."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This arquebus was the personal tool of Devio Fortunito, a Vailian gun for hire. It utilizes a powerful black-runepowder blend and fires conical slugs through a spiral threaded barrel. The gun is unmatched in range and penetrative power. Devio used it to great effect over his bloody career.

His most noteworthy act of marksmanship took place at the funeral of Agati Salagna, a minor functionary of the Vailian shipwright's guild. The guildsman, though two days' dead - by Devio's hand, no less - drew quite a crowd to his interment service. Throngs of mourners filled the chapel of Berath in the gardens of Revua. Among the crowd was none other than Traria Salagna, the head of the Salagna clan and a brazenly corrupt bureaucrat. She was Devio's target. 

Devio, perched atop the nearby ducal mausoleum, was annoyed to find his sightline to Traria obstructed by the chapel bells. While it complicated the shot, it would not save Traria. Devio took aim and fired. The slug punched through the three brass bells, sounding a chime that drowned out the gun's report. The crowd, startled by the sudden cacophony, watched in horror as the Salagna matriarch fell dead, shot cleanly through the heart.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This impressive ship has become the symbolic vessel of the Vailian Republics. Originally constructed as dedicated cargo craft, many early galleons fell prey to pirates and privateers. Such a ship represents a considerable investment of capital. To deal with ever-present threats, modern shipwrights have sacrificed some of the galleon's impressive cargo space to facilitate expanded gundecks, turning the vessel into a heavily armed and versatile warship. Its heavy timber hull has been likened to the walls of a castle, though such protection comes at the cost of speed and maneuverability.

      <DefaultText>When the Huana of old set out on grand seafaring voyages, they did so in outrigger canoes. These multihull boats were fast and durable enough for explorers to reach the corners of the known world. The voyager represents the evolution of the outrigger design. The twin hulls provide excellent stability even in rough seas, and large triangular sails make the vessel exceedingly fast. Though it lacks the hull strength and cargo space of larger vessels, the voyager is highly maneuverable and presents a difficult target for enemy gunners. Due to a lack of dedicated gundecks, the ship's cannons are mounted on the main deck. Twin chase guns allow the voyager to engage enemies directly ahead while a single aft-facing cannon provides a firing arc to the rear.

      <DefaultText>The junk represents a method of shipbuilding unique to the storm-beaten seas of Rauatai and serves as the workhorse of the kingdom's naval and merchant fleets. Outfitted with large, battened sails, this vessel can achieve surprising speed despite its size. The spacious hull is divided into several watertight bulkheads to prevent flooding, and each compartment houses a well-armed gundeck. The junk boasts cargo space and armament unparalleled by even Vailian galleons. Its tall hull and rigging, however, present a large target for enemy gunners, and the softwood hull affords little protection from cannon fire.

Long have the songs of her adventures filled noble halls and humble taverns alike, though no song sung or poem penned has succeeded in truly describing Sasha's grace with a blade.

Her scimitar, an antique blade of exquisite artistry, stirs the air when swung, humming with a particularly vibrant frequency. The sound is a complex, dissonant harmony, beautiful and jarring. It is both a tool of battle and an instrument of song. If the nicks along the silver-plated edge are any indication, the great chanter carried this scimitar for many years and crossed blades with many foes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Vincolo Scordeo acquired this sabre from the third and final captain he ever led a mutiny against. He didn't have anything against the captain personally. She had rescued him from the abandoned atoll after his old crew deposed him, after all. She had even brought him on as a deckhand. She was a proper pirate - Scordeo just wasn't suited to life as a deckhand. He was a captain, after all, and a captain needed a ship to command.

He was practiced at mutiny. He gathered a small group of dissatisfied collaborators from among the crew and confronted the captain as she stood at the helm. First he disarmed her. He had had his eye on her sabre for a while. Then he offered her a choice - relinquish command or die. The captain, dumbfounded, was unable to say anything. Scordeo shot her dead. Once again, he found himself in command. Ever generous, he elevated his chief collaborator, a young pirate by the name of Aeldys, to first mate. She was ruthless and ambitious, but surely loyal to him - or so he thought.</DefaultText>

The fercönyng's court was rumored to pay well for such artifacts and the brigands hoped to fetch a good price for the morning star when they returned to the Empire. Unfortunately for them, they were intercepted by a scouting party of the Glanfathan Fangs and charged with violating the sacred site. The evidence against the looters was overwhelming and they were summarily sentenced to death. The Fangs carried out the sentence at the threshold of the ruins, using this morning star as the means of execution. The Aedyran's bodies were left as a warning to other potential despoilers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This club originates from the little-known sacking of Munga Waikinga, an obscure Rauataian village. The villagers were taken by complete surprise when a band of slavers descended on them. The slavers quickly overwhelmed the few guards and set to work rounding up the terrified people and killing those too old, too young, or too weak to fetch a good price at auction.

One teenage girl, Lula Ko was not about allow the villains to harm her infant brother or enfeebled grandmother. Resolved not to surrender without a fight, she broke into the chapel of Woedica in the village common and plucked a torch from above the alter. She dipped it in pitch and smashed the priest's reflecting mirror, creating a club crowned in jagged glass. She prayed forgiveness from Woedica for her sacrilege and went out to confront the slavers. 

The girl's boldness surprised the slaver captain and he was only able to laugh before Lula Ko killed him with a single blow to his head. The villagers, inspired by Lula Ko's bravery, revolted against their captors - winning the day against all odds. The people of Munga Waikinga forever honored the warrior-child, as she and her sacred weapon were surely blessed by Woedica.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Rufus Aechmont, elder gunsmith of the Forged in Fire - a militant Magranite war band - crafted this arquebus for his own use during the Saint's War. Unwilling to trust his life to a weapon unless it had the blessing of Magran, he melded fire and steel into an instrument of blazing destruction.
 
The gun's firing mechanism is unique, as it does not rely on flint or match to spark the pan. Instead ornate, arcane symbols on the hammer and frizzen provide the necessary ignition for the primer. This "runelock," as Rufus called it, is effective and reliable. Dragon's Dowry fires lead balls wreathed in fire. When loaded with rune powder it can belch forth a torrent of pure flame.
 
Unfortunately, the unstable magics that provide such power are unpredictable. On occasion hot powder can blow backwards upon firing, burning the shooter. Rufus saw this not as a drawback of his creation but as a just offering to Magran.

      <DefaultText>The young brigand who once wielded this arquebus had not intended to become a murderer. Those he threatened down the twin barrels had a simple choice. All they had to do was hand over their valuables and go on their way. The gun was intimidating enough. No one was supposed to get hurt. When an old aumaua priest decided to fight back, the brigand acted on instinct and pulled the trigger. It took two shots to put the fool down.

The killing got easier after that. In fact, it became the rule rather than the exception. Searching corpses was simpler than robbery and just as lucrative. He kept the gun with him at all times, even while he slept. His dreams were filled with a morbid parade of those he had killed. Over the years he found his heart hardened. He could feel nothing, not even regret. Unable to reconcile the young man he had been with the jaded monster he had become, the brigand - numb and resigned - used the gun to take his own life.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This estoc was once the personal weapon of the legendary Dyrwoodan knight, Lady Kaul. As the field marshal of a border barony, she was responsible for defending the vassals of the land from the roving bands of independent hill-people who frequently crossed into the Dyrwood to pillage. She was a tireless warrior and a canny commander. She waged a decade-long campaign against all manner of brigands and marauders.

When she was killed during a retaliatory attack on an enemy stronghold, her officer cadre recovered her weapon and sent it to the duc of the Dyrwood with a letter informing him of the passing of his tireless servant. A fragment of Lady Kaul’s soul purportedly remains within the estoc’s pommel, eager to lend aid in battle once again. The blade almost seems to hum with barely-constrained longing to join in righteous combat.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While the practice of whaling has largely declined throughout the Deadfire, there are still those who hunt the beasts the Huana call "mohorā," both for subsistence and profit. This spear was designed to pierce, tether, and slay such giants of the deep. Though no longer used for sea-hunts, it functions admirably as a martial weapon.</DefaultText>

She had no intention of dishonoring herself or the hunt by merely maiming her quarry. If she failed to grant the animal a clean kill, the barbed spearhead at least granted her assurance her prey would tire, weaken, and expire from blood loss.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Azure Circle started as little more than a band of street thugs. They used extortion and bribery to convince the authorities to turn a blind eye to their many disreputable deeds. In doing so, the rakes found they had free rein to do as they pleased. Their gang soon grew into a criminal empire the rival of any guild in Eora.

This empire was built on coin acquired through illicit trade, protection schemes, and - as it had been since their founding - out-and-out robbery. When clients, rivals, or associates refused to comply with the wishes of the Circle, they would quickly find themselves at the mercy of the organization's enforcers - remorseless killers clad in azure blue cloaks who would ambush their victim en mass and stab them to death.</DefaultText>

There, if the legends are to be believed, Galawain gave Omaku charge over life and death on the island. He was tasked to maintain the balance of predator and prey, strong and weak. The penitent Omaku thus became the warden of Galawain’s creation, culling and healing in equal stride. He spent the long days of his life in service to the sanctity of the hunt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This simple broom was never intended to function as a weapon. The curious enchantments it holds are designed to make it more effective at its job - namely, sweeping. It is an ideal tool for cleaning dusty floors and shooing away pesky rodents. As at least one innovative eoten can attest, it also works exceptionally well as a backscratcher, provided one’s back is broad enough.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This glowing flail was blessed during a solar eclipse by the Glanfathan apostate priest Elws Mârawn. Elws believed that Eothas and Ondra were not two separate entities, but rather two aspects of a single god. He considered the eclipse, the embrace of the sun and moon, to be the ultimate expression of this fact. Furthermore, he preached against the very existence of any other gods.

At the height of the eclipse the apostate raised his flail to the heavens and blessed it in the name of the One Unified God. At that moment his eyes burned and he was instantly struck blind. The weapon was indeed imbued with power, but the sacrifice for this blessing was steep. Some of Elws' followers were convinced this was proof of the truthfulness of his claims, while others saw it as nothing more than divine punishment for his blasphemies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An ash-shafted spear with a bright bronze head. It is imbued with the spirit of an unpredictable dog. Aedhor Maydr, a Dyrwoodan thayn, was fond of his pack of hounds, especially Wicked Beast, a most ill-tempered, half-blind mongrel. The bitch would snap at everyone, including her master. She was Aedhor's favorite because her will could not be bent like the other dogs. Wicked Beast would bite any creature in her vicinity. Such was her belligerence, Aedhor took to wearing a thick glove to pet the hound. As the hound aged, her temper never waned, though her health diminished. Near the end, she lacked the strength to do more than muster a pitiful snarl. Aedhor knew her days were numbered. He tasked an animancer to transfer the dog's soul into a fine pike as a means to preserve her bestial, untamed essence. Much of Wicked Beast's soul was lost to the process, though the weapon holds her essential nature. It is a temperamental item, likely to strike at its wielder as their enemies. Its power and aggression, however, are undeniable.</DefaultText>

This afternoon I walked the streets of Neketaka and felt an unusual spring in my step. I cannot be sure if it is the fine weather of the archipelago or my great distance from the Dyrwood and the blasted Goose and Fox Inn that has gifted me this buoyancy of spirit, but I am grateful nonetheless.

I have seen no sign of the girl, Hylea be praised. Gods willing I have slipped her net at last.

Mecwynsdag
The shadows are strange here, seeming to move of their own accord. As I passed from Queen's Berth to Periki's Overlook this morning, I could have sworn I saw one turn to face me, then another. I fled the area as quickly as I could, and as far as I can tell, I was not followed.

I have many enemies - as any man of a roguish, adventurous mien should - though none have cause to search for me here. I know these shadows must be but a trick of the mind, but still I am uneasy."

The next entry is written in a shaky, wild hand, clearly penned in great haste.

"Rytlingsdag
As I put me down to bed this evening, I heard a faint whispering beneath my window. I always leave it open to better catch the breeze, and thanks be to Hylea for it, or I might have been none the wiser. However, when I went to investigate, no one was there. And yet I know, I KNOW I heard voices. I may be old, perhaps even paranoid, but I am NOT crazy.

I must leave this place with all haste. Gods protect me in my flight."

      <DefaultText>Beza was part of a famous Vailian dueling society. Their standard duel was with a one handed weapon and fought until first blood. Most duelers would wear minimal metal armor but light leather or thick padded cloth, just enough protection to stop a glancing swing. Beza had a blade constructed that proved to be extremely effective against their leather and cloth armors, as the serrated edge would catch and slice through the thin protection.

On her death, Beza's spirit managed to carry this blade beyond the Veil. It now exists in both realms, able to damage spirits and mortal foes alike.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This type of cannon was made popular during the final years of the War of Defiance. It is inexpensive to construct, lightweight, and reliable. The short, broad barrel earned its derisive nickname from Aedyran commanders on both land and sea. Lord Commander Sigfryd Rulth, of the Aedyran Overland Regiment is famously quoted, "I am unsure which is more stubborn - a Dyrwoodan fighting his betters, or the hog nose he fights us with."

The range of the hog nose is limited, but its light weight is advantageous to a ship's overall speed and maneuverability.</DefaultText>

      <ID>3770</ID>
      <DefaultText>At the height of his power, the Grand Vailian emperor Matenici III commissioned his royal shipwrights to build him a vessel that could not be sunk. Try as they might, the greatest engineers, craftsmen, and artisans in the empire were unable to deliver on such a demand. As failures mounted, so thinned the emperor's patience. Eventually Matenici implemented a policy of executing those he deemed responsible for repeatedly failing to carry out his will, a crime he equated to high treason. Shipwrights began to refer to the cursed project as the "Red Dream of Mad Matenici." 

The decades-long venture ended with the emperor's untimely death by the hand of his chief minister. While ultimately unsuccessful, the project did yield substantial advances in the field of hull reinforcement. Contemporary shipbuilders call the construction method the "Red Dream" in acknowledgment of the blood shed by their forbearers.
 
There are rumors of a pirate captain sailing a ship by the name of Red Dream within the waters of the Deadfire as well. Whether this is true or merely another sea story remains to be seen.</DefaultText>

In one such early battle, Rekvu was set fire by a devious wizard. She continued to fight through the horde of enemies, her armor ablaze, until she slit the throat of a bitter rival, whose blood finally quenched the wizard's flames. Rekvu suffered such terrible burns, she was unconscious for several weeks while her body healed.

Near the end of her life, Rekvu was pulled into battle once again, this time against a horde of eoten unleashed on a quiet mining village by an opportunistic noble from a distant nation. An eoten wielding a monstrous greatsword caught Rekvu unawares in the thick of the fighting and slammed her blade into Rekvu's head. Rekvu dashed the blood from her eyes and leapt on the eoten, knocking him to the ground. With one great swing of her ax, Rekvu severed both of the eoten's heads.

When the remaining eotens were slain and the invading noble's body was quartered and given to the sea, Rekvu dashed the blood from her eyes and pulled off her cracked helmet - only to discover that the eoten's attack had cleaved her ear clean off.</DefaultText>

In the heat of one such battle, Rekvu charged the field alone against a troop of Bleak Walkers - for all those who might have fought beside her sprawled dead at her feet. She slew the paladins one by one until at last she stood before their leader. The paladin leader was fast, faster even than Rekvu, and severed her hand with a swipe of his broadsword. But Rekvu was clever, and she tripped the paladin leader. As he fell into the mud, she cleaved him from neck to navel.

Assured that her enemy was dead, Rekvu tore off her other gauntlet and used its glove as a makeshift tourniquet. When the battle was ended and her wound tended to, Rekvu left her stained gauntlets behind.</DefaultText>

Its construction was costly and the resulting piece, while beautiful, would never fulfill its purpose.

Long before the people of the Deadfire had access to advanced metalworking, weapons and tools were often made of obsidian - which can be knapped to razor sharpness. Many aumaua warriors wielded obsidian clubs similar to this, which require considerable strength to swing with any accuracy. If the markings etched into the weapon are any indication, this bludgeon was the personal weapon of a grand champion. The glyphs tell of glorious battles against numerous foes.</DefaultText>

Armed with a spear, she set out to swim the breadth of the Spiny Reef - a shark-infested shallow beset by powerful surf and unpredictable tides. As she fought the waves, a massive pōraga shark ambushed her from below. If legends are to be believed, Akola battled the shark for three days before emerging as the victor. Exhausted but triumphant, she towed the defeated beast to shore. Its meat fed the people of her village for a month, and with the shark's skin and teeth Akola created this impressive shield.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An Effigy of Skaen is only brought into being by those who are so oppressed they are willing to perform horrific, unspeakable acts to strike down their persecutors. The ritual requires a willing worshiper to submit to disfigurement, mutilation, and certain death. If the offering is accepted, Skaen manifests in the supplicant, transforming them into an unstoppable avatar of the god's will, and sets out to brutally slay the oppressors of the faithful. When the monster's bloodlust is sated, the effigy literally falls apart, its task fulfilled. 

The remains of the creature are understandably avoided. They rot slowly, as even scavengers and vermin seem wary of touching such a carcass. It seems some daring or deranged tailor was not so discouraged. The stitching of this garment is rough but serviceable, and the mismatched patches of flesh have been treated with preserving oils. The macabre robe has the unmistakable stink of freshly tanned hide.</DefaultText>

She used the weapon as a testbed for her ambitious experiments with various elemental blights. Her goal was to capture such a spirit within the weapon and to exploit its energies.

She tinkered with the design for weeks - modifying, enchanting, and replacing the components until, eventually there were no original parts left. At the heart of the pistol's mechanisms she created what she called a "soul cage." To this bundle of binding copper and transmuted gems she bound a particularly potent storm blight, infusing the weapon with the power of elemental lightning.</DefaultText>

An exception was made when the legendary Aedyran duelist Rännig Daecia petitioned to join. He was ushered into the ranks of the Vailian elite and amazed onlookers and opponents alike with breathtaking displays of swordsmanship. His contemporaries noted that he never fought with any embellishment or grandeur. Rather, he displayed a flawless mastery of fundamental techniques. 

Rännig was gracious in victory and humble in defeat, although the latter is only speculation. According to the society's records, he never lost a bout. Even his rapier was without pretension, lacking the filigree and finery of most Vailian weapons, though his compatriots did not hold that against him.

The tortoise had served as the enchanter's best companion and finest test subject for over two centuries. Gorgamoth was ideal in his role as a wizard's pet. He never complained and seemed to hold the world, and everyone in it, in the same contempt as his master. Gorgamoth was also inexplicably resistant to the enchanter's spellcraft, shrugging off even the most powerful spells. This quality saved the tortoise from many of the enchanter's raging tirades or more misguided experiments. When the surly old beast finally succumbed to age, the enchanter found himself alone. Not one to wallow in his grief, he decided to turn Gorgamoth's carcass into something useful.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>My dearest Watcher,

A god with an agenda tends to put things into perspective. Now more than ever, it is imperative we commandeer the Floating Hangman if only so that we may chase Eothas to Ukaizo.

I have called a meeting of the Consuaglo mes Casitàs. Please, sail to Dunnage and join us as swiftly as the winds will bring you. 

Fortune favor you,
Captain Furrante

      <DefaultText>An animancer created this staff of copper and prismatic adra in order to bind blights. The captured blights infused the copper staff with control of the elements, turning it into a sort of elemental battery. Incidentally, the animancer found that this process also allowed his invention to rip soul fragments from victims to charge the effects of the staff.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gwyn, having fled her wedding, planned to sail as far away from her old life as possible. With not a coin to her name she was forced to trade the few items of value she had. With her wedding band she secured passage to Aedyr. At the urging of the kind boatswain she traded her necklace and earrings for a private cabin. The cook accepted her handkerchief in exchange for a few extra rations. 

Every item Gwyn traded felt like a weight falling from her shoulders - a weight she gave up gladly. When the ship made port, Gwyn gifted this lace band to the first person she met on the docks, wishing him safe travels. The orlan mariner who received it was delighted, if perplexed. He wore it around his waist for many safe, successful voyages, never forgetting the hopeful face of the young woman who gave it to him.</DefaultText>

Try the low-caste types first, the Roparu. They're used to hard work and they don't ask for more than their share.

      <DefaultText>Whatever Oderisi did to that last batch, it's working. We're seeing much higher concentrations of essence in the harvested adra.
I only wish he'd let the rest of us in on his methods. One of our Huana workers got the jolt of his life transporting one of the crates, and that's on top of the one that got blinded last week.
All Oderisi has to say for himself is that they were 'careless.' 
I'm the one paying these islanders' families out of my own pocket. At this rate I'm going to be the one idiot who comes out of this whole enterprise with less money than I started.

      <DefaultText>It has been a stroke of unimaginable fortune to find an adra vein in such pristine condition. The essence is so concentrated here that, even from the far side of the corridor, the pillar's light pulses like a star. At times I almost feel as if I can sense it, like the warmth of sunlight upon the skin.

We will need to reinforce the central chamber before attempting further excavations. The ruins are unstable, and Sela's motley workforce of savages and paupers grows more fearful by the day.


With the assistance of a single Watcher, we could trace the essence in the primary vein, and isolate those deposits worthy of extraction. I've petitioned Director Castol in Neketaka for such a resource, but I am continually rebuffed. 

It is unthinkable that the Vailian Trading Company cannot isolate, within the vast borders of its considerable influence, a single suitable candidate.


I must assume that the wretched Elette woman is hoarding them for her fanciful experiments. Transportation! As if we have the time to expend on such frivolities.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One thing we haven't been lacking for is pottery. 
Oderisi wasn't terribly excited about my little hobby, up until I explained that a single clay urn can fetch a very pretty sum when offered to the right collectors. 
Most of the artwork is too faded to make much sense of, and the rest is standard. Figures fighting one another, or being presented with victory wreaths.
All very proper. I bet if I had one of the Huana craftsmen make a few unsavory additions we could double the price.

      <DefaultText>I wasn't sure about the constructs at first. 

These new techniques may be less extreme than those of eccentrics like Galvino, but it gets harder to remember that once the hulking things are moving around like large, noisy, witless dolls.

The constructs require daily maintenance, and they make the workers uncomfortable. 

Still, they've been an effective deterrent to the local wildlife, and I have to admit I've started to feel safer with one of them standing nearby while I work.

Oderisi despises the things, and avoids them if possible. That alone is a considerable benefit.</DefaultText>

In service of Gaun, Xoti carries a similar tool - emulating the holy act of reaping. This sickle, while outwardly ordinary, has inherited power from Xoti's strong faith.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gunpowder has been used in the Old Empires and Eastern Reach for several centuries, but it is only in the past two hundred years that it has been put to use in cannons and personal weapons. A blend of charcoal, niter, and sulfur, in precise proportion, gunpowder burns quickly when ignited, making it an ideal propellant. Inventive alchemists also utilize this volatile powder to create powerful blasting charges and explosives, both for industry and warfare.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While alchemists utilize knowledge of the mundane world to manufacture gunpowder, ambitious practitioners of magic have created an alternative. Rune powder, crafted through a process similar to the techniques used to make grimoires, burns hotter and faster than black powder and is easier to ignite, making it more reliable, especially in inclement weather. For these reasons, it is exceedingly valuable, both to soldiers and sailors, who must often fire their weapons in the wet and cold.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>So. You had a little run in with Ben, and then you dragged it to my doorstep. You could've wiped your feet before you stomped in. But I digress.

I know what you did, and I know who you are. And unlike my unfortunately blockheaded second-in-command, I recognize a threat when it smacks me upside the head. So. This is me, Captain Aeldys - commander of the godsdamned new blood Príncipi, leader of the second largest fleet of pirates in the gods-fucking Deadfire - inviting you, a terrifyingly powerful and strange Watcher, to come and meet with me under the strictest parley at Fort Deadlight. Which is to say, I promise not to gut you when you arrive for dinner and drinks.

Looking forward to having a little hearthside chat. I would like to offer you a partnership of the most glorious and goriest variety. I scratch your back, you gut my enemies from hip to jaw. We laugh at their deaths over a bottle of the finest rum.

Oh, and when you come, bring some candied nuts.

Your newest and dearest friend,

I hear you've got a deal (another one, really?) going on with Furrante to muck around in the mess that is Crookspur Island. Before you go sailing in to do that cock-rot's bidding, come and have a chat with me, will you? I've got a proposition for you I think you'll find wickedly enticing.

I'll reserve a berth for [Player Ship] at Fort Deadlight's docks.

Your most ruthless but truthful friend (or damn my blood),
Aeldys

PS - Bring some more candied nuts. You know how I like them.

"Mestre Furrante, 

I have no interest in the details of your agreement with Mestre Kua, if indeed that is the creature's name. Nor will I insult either of us by feigning interest in your accounts. Do with the cargo as you please. You have demonstrated a head for business, but if I must caution you even now against wastefulness you are beyond my aid.

We are now in a position where we must trust one another. I trust that you understand our bargain will endure only so long as it is of benefit to the Company which I represent.

Just as I trust you understand that the moment this ceases to be the case, I will not trouble either of us in seeking your excuses and apologies. I will forget your name, mestre, and the Company privateers will show you and your crew no more mercy than any other disreputable outlaw.

With that understanding between us, let us proceed now as friends.

I have enclosed a writ for your safe passage, should you require it, and express renewed hope that you may one day seek to rejoin us in a more civilized setting.

Respectfully,
Ignato Castol"</DefaultText>

&lt;i&gt;We read the books not yet written
We see beyond the shroud of death
We seek the heart of all knowledge
We walk on planes beyond

Defy the Wheel
Defy death

Take the seal, the eye, the mark

Awaken&lt;/i&gt;

Inscribed along the shaft of the scepter is the phrase "Esoterica Proliferada."</DefaultText>

Merely holding the parchment fills you with a sense of dread. When you run your thumb over the skull, your pulse quickens like the beating of a drum. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Taken from the halls of Durgan's Battery, this dwarven cannon was never intended for use on the high seas. It fires heavy iron shot over a vast distance and is capable of inflicting great damage to enemy ships. The ammunition is cumbersome, however, and the weapon's prodigious bulk prevents use of a traditional gun carriage. This makes reloading an arduous affair. Adjusting aim with the gun is time-consuming, so it is generally calibrated to fire at a fixed distance, which requires a target to be within a narrow optimum range.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This strange animancer's device consists of an extravagant hilt crafted to a jeweler's precision. The pommel, which contains a complex web of binding copper and adra, houses a soul from an unknown source. When activated, the soul is released from the emitter only to be pulled back into the adra contacts after traveling a prescribed distance. This disruptive process tears at the edges of the soul, releasing powerful energies along its periphery. The soul is thus caught in a fixed loop that functions as a blade.</DefaultText>

Then, with a mighty shout, the warrior challenged Nemnok to battle.

After a brief and one-sided bout, Nemnok subdued the would-be usurper and set to work torturing him to death. Remarkably, the cape sustained its reputation and the dwarf stubbornly clung to life for quite some time.</DefaultText>

"A gift for you, my friend, made by the gold-plated maniacs of the Living Lands. May your feet be swift, fingers nimble, and your drinks always on the house." - From Antonino of Biageppe, addressed to an unnamed thief in the Vailian Republics

"Here, Twitch. For that thing we talked about. Save me a seat at the bar?" - An unnamed thief, in a letter to Nyfre, a thief of the Dyrwood

"I can't let a treasure like this fall into House Do-Nothing-Well's hands, so it's yours as long as you can keep it. Follow your 'heart', and don't get dead." - Nyfre, in a letter to one 'Langden', most recently of Defiance Bay</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>For most of her life, Kaethys of Readceras had paid no heed to the laws of gods nor kith. She was a crook, concerned with little but her own venal pleasure. When Saint Waidwen revealed his divine nature upon the pillory, however, her heart and mind opened to the light of Eothas and his prophet.

When Waidwen deposed the corrupt government and marched on the Dyrwood, Kaethys took up arms in his name. The Divine King presented her with this purple cape and instructed her to be his vanguard against the unbelievers. Thus blessed, she met the Dyrwoodans in the field clad in violet.

Beset by foes, she fought with the fury of the righteous, her cape swirling around her. No blow went unanswered. Her victories mounted and she led her cohort of militant faithful until the battle of Halgot Citadel, where the Godhammer ended her crusade in a blast of metal and stone. Waidwen was gone. Later, before her capture, Kaethys was seen searching the debris as her troops fled. Her cape was nowhere to be seen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ajamuut's life was one of sacrifice. As the matron huntress it fell to her to feed her nomadic tribe. In order to provide she lived apart, tirelessly stalking the herds. Her tribe followed, always one horizon behind, so as not to disturb the hunt. When the tribe saw the glow of a distant fire they knew their huntress had made a kill, and moved forward. Arriving at the dying coals, they would find a fresh carcass, trussed and dressed. Ajamuut had invariably moved on.

Ajamuut was known for her ability to soundlessly approach her quarry and strike with deadly precision. The howling winds and bitter cold offered few second chances. This cloak helped conceal her, both on open tundra and under dark forests, as its subtle pattern disguised her silhouette from even the most keen-eyed prey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Few merchants appreciate the harsh weather and grave hazards that afflict those traveling the open seas, and many purchase oilskins stitched from tar-treated sailcloth. Those who can afford to do so commission enchanters to etch the inside of the cloak with mystic runes, warding it against the elements.

The runes in this cloak suggest an origin among the wizards of Rauatai.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ruata was born into the Roparu caste of her tribe. Fostered by laborers, she was taught that her life of hard work would be but a prelude to her next life of duty, respect, and responsibility. All the same, she was not so content to wait. 

Ruata set out from her tribe and wandered the isles, taking but a single possession - her cloak. She lived off the land and hunted when able, growing in her acclaim as a tribeless curiosity and storyteller. She made friends and enemies in great abundance with nary a regret, for her path was always before her. Ruata's fate is unknown, but her name is often whispered among the Roparu, who learned to believe that not all paths are predetermined.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the many accoutrements of famed Vailian magician Mallia ne Spettacolira, this cape went missing during the finale of her most memorable show along with Mallia herself and a sizable portion of those in attendance. It reappeared only recently, flying atop a flagpole in the Sacred Stair district of Neketaka. Mallia had fulfilled her promise. They had indeed seen her. Now they did not.

Several other props have been recovered over the years. The Box of Death and Dismemberment materialized at the wedding of Erlu Lüfolcg in the Dyrwood, where it brought a dramatic conclusion to the nuptials by crushing the father of the bride. The Tumbling Ring of Conflagration is said to have apparated onto the deck of a Huana gunboat in the Deadfire some weeks later, though surviving crew members tell conflicting accounts of what started the resulting fire.

Of the great magician and her audience, there has been no sign.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Badrwn, an orlan warrior from the Fisher Crane tribe, served Eír Glanfath with distinction during the War of the Black Trees. He was infamous among the encroaching soldiers of the Dyrwood for his rapid, daring raids into the hearts of their outposts, primarily under the cover of darkness. Badrwn's cloak, much like its former owner, is a practical thing. Dirt, moss, and blood have made the simple homespun garment into a mottled mosaic that seems to disappear amongst the rocks and trees. The frayed hem is silent, even when drawn over stone and dry leaves. 

With the Glanfathan defeat and the end of the war, Badrwn and his most loyal followers made their way to the Deadfire, where they plundered merchant ships for many years. This cloak is all that remains of the fabled leader.</DefaultText>

The Dyrwoodans fought valiantly but their disorganized light infantry was no match for the Aedyran heavy regiment. Overwhelmed, the rebels were killed nearly to a man. According to several Aedyran soldiers, Maxeyl was the last to fall. Surrounded and badly wounded, he refused the Aedyran commander's offer for quarter. It took a dozen spears to put the rebel down, and even then he continued to fight until he was beheaded.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This fine sharkskin belt is thought to have been in the possession of the widowed elf noble Devka Kilwyn when she took her own life by throwing herself from a coastal watchtower into the crashing sea below. Some years later the girdle washed ashore near a Huana village in the Deadfire, where a wandering shorewalker discovered it. The salt and tide had not marred it in the slightest. The inner lining still bore the embroidered message to Devka from her late husband. "May our souls always find one another," it read. The shorewalker, wary of the implications of such an artifact, opted to sell it rather than tempt the ire of Ngati, who had surely kept a weather eye on such a symbol of love, loss, and the sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The creator of this belt realized that organization is necessary for a healthy, fulfilled life. In an effort to organize her ever growing supply of arcane scrolls, she needed a safe, secure place to keep them. Considering the sheer volume of scrolls in her admittedly horde-like collection, this safe place needed to be essentially infinite in size but small enough to be handy. A few experimental enchantments later, she created just that. One by one, over the course of many weeks, she tucked each and every scroll she owned into the folds and loops of her spellkeeper belt. Unfortunately, the scrolls never seemed to come out of the belt in the same order she put them in. In her opinion, this seemed a small price to pay for the peace of mind afforded by a well-organized home.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>All Glanfathan children know the story of the orlan folk hero Mewnan and his time on the run from the cruel Dyrwoodan slaver, Dôen. Cornered after many weeks fleeing his pursuers, Mewnan took shelter among the tents and pavilions of the Sercws Chwdroth, a wandering carnival, where the circus master Rik the Larger took pity and hid him from the devilish Dyrwoodans.

Mewnan showed the circus master his magic belt, which he had stolen from the candy house of the bog hag Evhildwn. The belt, he said, gave him the strength of five aumaua and agility greater than any elf. Amazed, Rik brought Mewnan into his circus as an acrobat. Mewnan soon became famous for his daring tumbling routines and acts of vigor.

When the greedy circus master saw how the crowds loved Mewnan, he became envious. One day he betrayed Mewnan to Dôen. When the slaver arrived to collect his quarry, Mewnan shocked him by leaping clear over Dôen's head onto the villain's own horse. Mewnan laughed as he rode to freedom and many other adventures. How his magic belt made its way here is another story altogether.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Príncipi captain who once wore this belt was not known to be "upright" because of his ethics or moral code. To the contrary, by all accounts he was quite a ruthless fellow. His crew admired their captain's unwillingness to back down from any challenge that came his way. Outgunned and outclassed, he would take the fight to ships larger than his own. He would sail through squalls and storms, standing resolutely at the helm. Always, he held fast. There was no force on Eora that could bend his back or force him to his knees. 

Of course, it was the captain's obstinacy that led to the inevitable destruction of his ship in a maelstrom. However, a man such as he is remembered for refusing to break, even if he is broken nonetheless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No paladin better personified the ethos of the Bleak Walkers than Hans Elechbert. He was a single-minded instrument of violence and the finest cavalry officer among the Bleak Walker companies operating in Dyrwood. His superiors utilized Hans and his troop of riders in the way one fires a cannon. Mounted atop powerful warhorses and clad in heavy plate, they broke enemy infantry formations with a single, pointed charge. 

Hans' helmet, designed to make him visible to his subordinates through the dust and viscera, became an icon of approaching death for any warrior brave or foolish enough to stand against the Bleak Walkers. When the paladin finally fell in battle, his few surviving enemies cut his head from his shoulders. According to legend, Hans' head continued to bellow from within the helm, ordering his men to press the charge and leave none alive. Dumfounded, the victors buried Hans' head unceremoniously and left his corpse to the ravens. The helm's travels, however, were not entirely at an end.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A navy sails on its stomach. This, above all things, was an axiom for Okura, chief galley cook of the Rauatai scout ship Waimara. Any crewman from the ship master to the lowest powder boy could rely on a steady, unending supply of Okura's famous stew. This was because Okura cooked little else. Stew at first watch. Stew at last watch.

Of course, the crew complained. Okura was untroubled. A crew that didn't complain was a crew short on work, if you asked her. She became a fixture of the vessel as captains and crews came and went. Okura and her cast iron pot remained at the ready to feed those under their charge.

When the Waimara fell victim to a rogue wave, Okura was lost at sea. The ship was scrapped for parts and its supplies redistributed among the Rauatai navy. The crew, however, stole away Okura's pot. In an act of finality they gave it to a local smith on the one condition he craft it into something, anything, other than a cooking vessel. They then toasted to Okura's memory and hoped beyond hope that whatever her pot became, it would never be used to cook stew again.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>No one knows for certain the true nature of the being known as the Bleak Mother. Some say she is the progenitor of a hundred-hundred young, terrible creatures that stalk in wild places best left forgotten, preying on kith and beast. Others maintain her domain is that of thorns and tangled roots, and that her children ensnare and devour those who wander off the path. Real or imagined, the Mother is only talked about in whispers by those who trek darkened woods and brave the untamed wilderness. 

The fellow who wore this horned helm, however, spoke in boast. He claimed to have met the dreadful Mother and slain her. These horns, he said, were proof of his deed. A pair of hunters would later discover the helmet in the heart of the Blackwood, its owner nowhere to be seen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A sailor of Vailian descent, Acina the Gaunt, a moniker she earned for her unusually lean frame, came of age in the Living Lands. Raised among ravenous beasts and carnivorous plants, the young dwarf took to the arbalest and arquebus shortly after she learned to walk. By the time she went to sea, she was one of the quickest shots around with either.

The impulsive Acina soon fell in with a ship granted a letter of marque by the Vailian Republics to counter Príncipi predation in the Deadfire. Though she earned her repute by the speed and accuracy of her shots, pirates around the region knew her almost as well for this hat, a sharp piece of headwear preserved with the fastidiousness born of the knowledge that few things pose greater danger than equipment ill-maintained.</DefaultText>

Eventually she would reveal herself, her terrible face concealed beneath a mask made of leaves, bark, and other dying things. When the child, terrified beyond sanity, could endure no more, Baasajujak would lower her mask, revealing her true visage. Her victims, it is said, then died of fright.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Vailian Admiral Felipo wore these gloves during his legendary shipboard duel with Jón Everbrok, the infamous Dyrwoodan privateer. At the height of the duel, with their respective crews clashing in a bloody melee all around them, the two commanders engaged in mutual combat beneath a storming sky. 

The fight turned in favor of Everbrok as the aging Felipo's endurance began to wane. Exhausted, the admiral redoubled his efforts in a final desperate assault. He drove Everbrok back, but only briefly. The pirate captain disarmed the admiral and prepared to deliver the killing stroke. Seeing his death was near, the honorable Felipo raised hand in salute to his opponent. 

At that moment, the sky opened and a bolt of lightning struck Felipo's iron gauntlets in a flash of blinding, white light. The blast arced to Everbrok, killing him instantly and sending him flying over the deck and into sea. Felipo's crew, emboldened by their commander's victory, rallied and won the day. 

After his retirement, the admiral locked away the gauntlets, wary of their power and unpredictability.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These leather gloves are cracked and discolored from contact with alchemical compounds and burning gunpowder. The fingertips, blackened from fuse and flame, still provide surprising dexterity and grip. The artificer, Elmae Buerst, crafted them during her time with a Dyrwoodan grenadier company during the Saint's War, where she oversaw the construction and implementation of the unit's explosives. 

Due to the rapidity of the Readceran incursion into the Palatinate, the Dyrwoodans were frequently short on supplies, even in their home territory. Elmae had to make do with what little powder and other components she had. As the war escalated, the artisan found her presence necessary on the front lines - both to resupply her troops and offer instruction. Her valiant leadership and the courage of her troops earned her company the moniker "Elmae's Firethrowers." Whether these gloves belonged to Elmae herself or one of her soldiers is unknown.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aegor Willuf had many passions - good &lt;xg&gt;food&lt;/xg&gt;, fine wine, fast women - but enjoyed none so much as the pastime of dueling. He never considered himself a violent man, but nor could he deny the pleasure of besting a rival in single combat. To that end, he made a point of taking offense at the smallest slight, demanding satisfaction from anyone who glanced sideways at him.

He would fight with blades, but pistols were his weapon of choice. He boasted the fastest draw and quickest aim in the Palatinate. Considering his record, no one alive was able to dispute the claim. 

In a particularly brazen act of swagger, he is said to have once allowed his opponent - the son of an influential erl - the first shot. If the legend is to be believed, Aegor caught the bullet in his hand midflight before shooting his young opponent dead. Aegor bragged endlessly about the remarkable catch. He credited his thick rawhide gloves - and undeniable prowess, of course - for saving his hand and his life.

The bereft erl soon sent a posse to arrest the braggart. Unaccustomed to fighting more than a single foe, Aegor found his speed and skill insufficient to prevent his date with the gallows.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before being canonized St. Drogga the Martyr, the Templar Drogga served the priesthood of Magran in Defiance Bay. When the temple chose to send a small group of Magranites to spread the word of the faith to the people of the Deadfire (encouraged by the city's duc in an effort to curb growing Vailian influence in the archipelago), Drogga eagerly volunteered to accompany the missionaries.

The mission served in the eastern islands for years before being slain to the last. Duc Durnsan Hadret hired a group of mercenaries to bring Dyrwoodan justice to the raiders responsible and secure any remains. While the group successfully avenged the missionaries, this grim trophy was all they recovered of the fated group. When the priests at the Shrine of Magran saw that the paladin's flame persisted even in death, they proclaimed her a martyr.

The Shrine of Magran granted this relic to the chapel at Caed Nua in recognition for your many services to the Dyrwood, and it somehow survived Eothas' rise from below that very structure. Returning again to the Deadfire, St. Drogga continues to cast light into the darkest shadows.</DefaultText>

"Watcher

Please. We need your help. We found a fissure. Collapse. Disturbed the spirits.

My son is trapped. The spirits attack all who come near.

We are on the island southwest of Neketaka. 

Please hurry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These heavy gauntlets easily outweigh any similar pair of plated gloves. The scalloped knuckles are lined with lead and the steel wrist guards are many times thicker than they ought to be for any practical purpose. Wearing them is like turning one's hands into bludgeons. Swinging them is a task unto itself, as stopping them in motion is nigh impossible.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>THIS IS THE WILL OF NEMNOK THE DEVOURER, MASTER OF THE MOUNTAIN.

BRING ME THREE TOMES OF POWER FROM THE GODLESS LANDS BEYOND THE DROWNED BARROWS. 

THE FIRST IS IN A FAR-FLUNG SWAMP, GUARDED BY ANCIENT AND POWERFUL HAGS. 
THE SECOND IS IN A GRAVEYARD OF LISTING SHIPS, CLUTCHED BY THE HUNGRY DEAD. 
THE LAST IS NESTLED IN THE HIDDEN ARCHIVE OF AN UNDYING SPELLCASTER. 

SERVE ME AND YOUR FAITH WILL BE REWARDED. DISAPPOINT ME, BETRAY ME, AND I WILL ADD YOUR FLESH TO THE VELLUM OF MY GRIMOIRE.

      <DefaultText>These plated boots are badly corroded around the heels. They were worn by a Bleak Walker at the battle of the Rakhan Moor, where the mercenary paladins infamously put down a fledgling peasant revolt on behalf of the local lords. The dissidents had taken refuge in the moor in hopes the unstable ground and acidic peat bogs would discourage pursuit. Undeterred, the Bleak Walkers marched on the peasants’ camp shoulder-to-shoulder, shields locked. Many of them sank into the fuming fen, dying with little protest. The terrified rebels watched in horror as the grim paladins who survived the deadly march accelerated into a final charge, breaking through the upstarts’ thin ranks before butchering them all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>My dear Wifruth,

I do not believe this letter shall ever make its way to you, but if you are reading it now, I must suppose it has, and my heart is glad for it.

No doubt you are furious with me for leaving as I did, in the very dead of night. I knew you would not accept what it is I intend to do, and I could not bear to see the hurt in your eyes when I walked out the door.

I have met a scholar whose brilliance is unsurpassed by any I have known. He is Awakened, Wifruth. All the many nested memories of his past lives are like an open book before him. Imagine!

He has said he will Awaken me, too - I need only renounce my present life, pledge myself to him, and meet him at the appointed time.

I am sorry, Wifruth. I do not ask that you forgive me, only that you understand - my previous lives call to me, and I am helpless to answer them. 

May we find each other in another, better life.

You're not sure where the eye patch came from, but it reeks of rum.

      <DefaultText>Edér chose not to return home to Gilded Vale. Still most comfortable living far from cities, he settled in Dyrford - which, like many towns in the Dyrwood, was beginning the slow process of rebuilding.

Believing now that it was the obligation of kith to be the leaders their gods had not been, Edér was soon named mayor of the town. Under his guidance, Dyrford began to prosper. He expelled the last of the Skaenites from the area and drew new settlers with the offer of land, a trick he had learned from someone he otherwise preferred to forget. With each passing day, Dyrford would come to more closely resemble the Gilded Vale of Edér's childhood - the one worthy of its name.

Upon his election, the local lord presented Edér with this medallion as a sign of official recognition and goodwill.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Edér chose not to return home to Gilded Vale. Through a number of quiet inquiries, he soon found his way into the underground organization of Eothasians known as the Night Market.

Ironically, in learning that the gods had been fabricated, Edér found his faith in Eothas renewed, and that his god was neither alive nor truly a god had become irrelevant. He rose quickly through the ranks of the Night Market for his optimism and for his bold leadership, his ultimate goal to make the Dyrwood a place that would welcome followers of the Shining God once again. This amulet, unassuming and easily hidden if need be, is a symbol of faith recognized by other secret worshipers. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The construct known as the Devil of Caroc eventually met her fate at the hands of the villagers of Maiden Falls, who tore her limb from limb. It seems that at least one industrious smith saw some use for her remains. This bronze breastplate was forged from the Devil’s chest piece, brass buckles, and rivets from her various clockwork mechanisms. While her soul has doubtless departed, the remains are not wholly inanimate. The metal, no longer a prison for the soul, nevertheless seems to have been infused with life force and retains some power.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fampyr Menzzago acquired this scepter long before his time in Splintered Reef. Even in his kith days he was an accomplished magic practitioner and the implement served to bolster his considerable powers. Those powers, however, were not enough to save him from the Deathguard Lucia Rivan. In fact, his mastery of the magic of the mind largely decided his fate. Upon turning the wizard into his fampyr form, Rivan tasked him as the custodian of her undead charges, a vigil he was well suited for. He kept the scepter in his possession, but its wondrous magic - much like Menzzago's soul - had been hardened towards a dark, single-minded purpose. It now serves only to dominate and control both the living and the dead.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When the volcano erupted on the far side of the island, Paoraw Aoaha - the ranga of the local Huana tribe - ordered the Roparu shorewalkers to scour the lava fields in search of valuable volcanic ash to fertilize the crops. While performing this duty, one shorewalker came about a small, white jewel resting atop the surface of a cooling lava pool. She carefully retrieved it. 

She took the gem to the village artisan - a Kuaru who occasionally dealt with the lower caste - and asked him to make a ring with the stone so she could properly present it to the ranga. The Kuaru recognized the gem as a piece of the heart of the volcano. It was a prize beyond the station of the Roparu, and the ranga surely would not appreciate its true value. He confiscated the jewel and sent the shorewalker away. He crafted a ring but had no intention of parting with it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These humble sandals once belonged to the Rauatai priest Ahu Taka, who kept no home and had no family. He chose a life of self-imposed exile, wandering the lands of Eora to heal the sick. He would aid anyone in need with no regard for their allegiances or past deeds. Shunned by the aristocracy and elites wherever he went, Ahu Taka ministered in the slums and brothels. He passed no judgment and offered only peace and acceptance. He was often observed after battles tending to the wounded and comforting the dying on both sides. 

This eventually drew the ire of a victorious commander. If the vagabond priest wanted to preach to whores and degenerates, that was fine, but healing the commander's enemies was a step too far. The commander ordered his troops to execute the meddling priest where he stood. When none of his men proved willing to carry out the order, the commander drew his own blade and struck Ahu Taka down. According to legend, Ahu Taka used his dying breath to offer his killer forgiveness.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This morning star was the favored instrument of the pitiless ogre executioner of the Crookspur slaver port. The executioner reveled in his job and routinely tormented captives with threats of death and mock executions. Nothing thrilled him so much as the inevitable, periodic slave uprisings. After putting down such a revolt, the slavers turned to him to execute the ringleaders to discourage future resistance from the chattel. The executioner was not known for killing his victims quickly or cleanly, and preferred to break bones before administering the killing blow.</DefaultText>

It would be my honor to host the savior of Hasongo at the Kahanga Palace. Neketaka is a city for Huana and outsiders alike, and there is no shortage of work for kith who are determined to be as useful as you. 

Should you have the stamina for a good climb, the palace atop Serpent's Crown could be your second home. Think on it. 

Regards, 
Queen Onekaza II</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>4458</ID>
      <DefaultText>This slim volume tells the tale of the Tacan, a people who lived along the banks of the Acqui River on the fertile Ixamitl Plains. It details their rise to prominence in the region and their eventual demise at the hands of their ancient enemies, the Quechmatl people.

A significant portion of the book is given over to examining the role of the Tacan's order of monks, the Nalpazca, in Tacan society. The Nalpazca believed that transcendence could only be attained by overcoming one's personal vanity, the desire for pleasure, and fear of death. To that end, they engaged in pointedly anti-social behavior, various forms of self-mutilation, and meditation with or consumption of the recently deceased.

The Nalpazca were led by an anitlei, or master warrior, the last of whom was a man named Ixepillo. Ixepillo was charged with protecting his people from the Quechmatl and other threats, but in a tragic twist of fate, Ixepillo died before he was able to pass on his sacred knowledge on to the man poised to take his place.

The book dwells on this failure for some time, its author apparently of the belief that it was this one error that gave the Quechmatl the opening they needed to launch their attack. The book's author goes on to describe how he attempted to instigate a popular uprising among his people against the Quechmatl, but his efforts were unsuccessful, as the Tacan were by then too broken by the destruction of their culture to muster much of a defense.

The volume concludes with an exhortation for the reader not to mourn the Tacan's passing, but to learn what they had to teach, and to teach others in turn.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>During his long custodianship of Splintered Reef, Menzzago maintained a near constant field of magic to control the undead under his command. It was an endless task. A living being would have gone mad from the mental drudgery. As a fampyr, however, Menzzago required only the most minor diversion to retain what remained of his sanity.

He set aside a tiny portion of his mind and reached out to the innumerable vermin of the Reef. He found kindred spirits in the many spiders skittering about his prison. They were like him, endlessly weaving and maintaining their tiny kingdoms. Also like him, they had a lovely work ethic.

So he put them to work. Using small fraction of his power, he induced the spiders to weave for him something pretty. Menzzago took great pleasure in how they danced like puppets on gossamer strings. Eventually the spiders produced for him a bolt of beautiful, durable silk. Menzzago made use of it to create this robe.</DefaultText>

While I am disappointed you've yet to come see me - I do understand. My little Sirens tell me you've been quite busy bloodying the Deadfire, for which I can certainly appreciate. Or perhaps my first missive to you was merely lost at sea?

Either way. 

I hear you've got a deal (another one, really?) going on with Furrante to muck around in the mess that is Crookspur Island. Before you go sailing in to do that cock-rot's bidding, come and have a chat with me, will you? I've got a proposition for you I think you'll find wickedly enticing.

I'll reserve our finest berth for [Player Ship] at Fort Deadlight's docks.

Your most ruthless but truthful friend (in possibility, should you choose),
Captain Aeldys

And get your stinking construct under control. It's been hanging out by that crystal. I swear it's been giving me the eye.

You located this dagger in the depths of Poko Kahara, where the murals suggested it was a sacrificial tool of ancient Engwith. It whispers its name to you.

      <DefaultText>If not for the food shortage, Ruānu would ask for what I bring so many crabs from the beach. They take to the sand at midnight and scuttle around my feet - as hungry as the rest of us, I say. The work is difficult enough without them pinching my ankles and going after the prize.

I thank Ngati for every day that Ruānu does not ask.

The shore warms by day and cools by night. If this will get the job done, then even Kohopa may forgive me. Only at midnight can I check. Some day the tribe will know what I do, but until that day... ekera, no one may know. 

In the meantime, I say the beach is so lonely.</DefaultText>

"NEVER allow imps to learn spells or wield artifacts of power. Their bodies sponge up the essence remainder and grow exponentially larger in size. One of my household servants pilfered a ring from my collection and grew to the size of an aurochs before I had him properly drained. 

Their glands also grow more pungent than mere writing can hope to encompass, so beware."

      <DefaultText>Though now extinct, the giant lizards known as garari once roamed the many islands of the Deadfire. They were fast, powerful, and cunning predators, hated amongst kith for their tendency to kill domestic goats and pigs if given half a chance. When foreign colonists arrived in the archipelago, many local governors placed an open bounty on any garari, and the creatures where soon hunted to oblivion. Now rare due to a lack of available material, hardened garari leather armor such as this is quite desirable, as it is tough and naturally flexible.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Known as the "Prudent Surcoat," this padded armor was worn by a Vailian folk hero named Antin Covardo. Unlike most other heroes from children's tales, the dashing Covardo was famous for escaping danger and avoiding disaster through cunning and foresight. His are not stories of adventure, narrow escapes, or barely-won battles. Rather the morals imparted by his tales focus on prudence, planning, and being brave enough to disregard one's pride and flee when necessary.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Many creatures have unwittingly contributed their pelts and bones to this armor. Each component has faded as though treated with lime, eventually becoming the same bone white color. The cause of this transformation is unknown. Whatever bestial enchantment lies upon the Pale Hide also affects the demeanor of the wearer. While clad in this grisly totem, one's mind begins to drift towards grand hunts under the moonlit sky, the glorious struggle of tooth and claw, and the undeniable ecstasy of the kill.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The master alchemist Donado Vinzzeti created this suit of gleaming scale armor not as a tool for battle, but as an expression of his craft. Untrained in the arcane art of enchantment, Vinzzeti sought to create a perfect elemental defense using only alchemical techniques. He labored over every scale, every stitch, and every rivet, distilling protective elemental essence into every component. The project consumed his every waking hour for nearly a year. The results - while more than satisfactory - never seemed to please the alchemist. His masterpiece was functional but far from &lt;i&gt;perfect&lt;/i&gt;. He grew discouraged and eventually discarded the armor, declaring it to be the culmination of his failure at his craft.</DefaultText>

It is imbued with the blood and malice of its many owners as well as their victims. Over the long years the blood has yet to dry. It runs in continuous rivulets from between the tarnished links. Occasionally the mail will flex, hungrily pulling the blood back into itself, loath to part with its hard-won prize.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina had followed her orders from the ducs bels, helping to establish an exclusive trade arrangement between the Vailian Republics and the tribes of Eir Glanfath. With the Dyrwoodans still weakened by Waidwen's Legacy, the Vailian Republics easily pushed their would-be competitors out of the market. The Dyrwood suffered as terribly from the lost trade as the Republics benefited from it. Pallegina was honored for her service by being assigned as the personal guard of the ducess Spireno. Despite her success, she regretted the choices she had made along the way.

As a symbol of her new station, Pallegina was presented with this gleaming breastplate. To wear such a piece of armor was a privilege reserved for those most trusted by the Vailian aristocracy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This is a crude yet effective instrument of subjugation. Countless prisoners, both slaves and convicts, bear similar fetters. While she could not be called its "owner," the most recent recipient of this shackle wore it for ten long years of servitude. When she could tolerate her thralldom no longer, she broke her own ankle to be free of the chain and bludgeoned her captors to death with it. The makeshift flail, empowered by the escapee’s desire for vengeance and refusal to remain in bondage, proved to be a powerful weapon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The blade is covered with graceful Glanfathan engravings. Whispers of Yenwood was once the sword of the first Roadwarden of Caed Nua.

When the Erl of Yenwood appointed Cafed Eodhart, the young lord feared the spirits that were rumored to dwell under the young castle's foundation. He spent a sizable sum to have the black Ymyran steel blade forged, shipped to the Eastern Reach for engraving by the erl's Glanfathan slave artisans, and enchanted in New Dunryd.

Cafed is known to have used the sword in the Battle of Old Geiran and to help the neighboring Raedrics suppress an uprising in Gilded Vale, but there is no recorded use of it in Caed Nua.

Over time, Cafed began to believe that the sword had been cursed by the Glanfathan artisans who decorated it. He confided in those close to him that he thought the spirits of the dead were speaking to him through the blade while he slept.

One evening, against the pleas of his wife and soldiers, a maddened Cafed carried the sword deep into the misty woods of Eir Glanfath. His body was never recovered, but the next Roadwarden the erl assigned to Caed Nua found it waiting for him on the throne in the keep's great hall. None of the soldiers could explain how the sword had appeared there. No Roadwarden has carried the sword since that day.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An Aedyran explorer once heard a legend of an Engwithan tomb filled with the dead empire’s greatest treasures. Dead-set on making a name and a fortune for himself, he had one of the finest smiths in the Dyrwood craft a blade worthy of his task.

He descended into a place known as the Endless Paths of Od Nua and was never heard from again. His possessions were scattered by the strange evils that dwelt within and his priceless blade was shattered. Eventually the Watcher of Caed Nua recovered the shards and reforged the weapon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A shaking hand penned this missive. The ink runs where fresh tears fell upon the parchment.

"Captain,

I am an artist crafted of water, not a killer chipped from stone. As I am not equal to serving on your &lt;xg&gt;crew&lt;/xg&gt;, and you have fallen below deserving the blessing of Ngati's son, I say we are poorly suited to each other's company.

May the Wheel grind the memory of your deeds into oblivion. May you forget this life in your next. By mother Ngati, I pray that you find the peace you seek.

Farewell, my captain.

Tekēhu"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This bronze sword is not associated with a great smith, but with a modest artisan. The young craftswoman, noted for her talent at engraving and jewelry, received the unfinished blade from her local lord with a commission for a brass crossguard and pommel. 

Elated at the trust shown in her talents, the artisan worked tirelessly to complete the order. As she etched and polished, her faithful dog Griffin stayed at her side day and night. As days turned to weeks, the artisan began to forego food and sleep in her effort to fulfill her commission. When she became discouraged, Griffin - her ever faithful companion - was there to encourage her with a nuzzle and a loving lick.

One day while working, the artisan looked down at her feet to find her beloved canine companion cold and still. Griffin had died curled at her feet, faithful to the last. Heartbroken, the artisan decided to commemorate the hound on the piece into which she had poured her heart and soul. She crafted the pommel into Griffin's likeness, taking some comfort in knowing that when the lord carried his sword, he too would always have a loyal companion at his side.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This pendant consists of dirty coin on a tarnished chain. The coin, while worth a few copper pieces, would be refused by any respectable merchant due to the hole drilled through it. Presumably its value is totally sentimental. When worn, however, the coin imparts a strange feeling of confidence, almost as if one can "feel" what is about to happen and act accordingly. The sensation is fleeting, however, and not totally reliable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In the early days of Vailian sea exploration, innumerable dangers threatened any ship setting out for uncharted waters. Far from proper medical aid, even minor injuries or illnesses could render a ship's crew ineffective, ending expeditions before they were complete. Such ventures were often funded by Vailian interests and represented considerable capital. Thus the admiralty commissioned the services of Gregori Felizze me Fontina, a renowned physician.

Working with enchanters and artificers, Fontina developed a method by which to transfer basic medical knowledge into affordably-made torcs which could be easily manufactured, shipped, and stored. These trinkets were widely distributed to ships' quartermasters and surgeons, allowing them to treat their crews more effectively. Following the amulets' introduction, the admiralty noted a slight but undeniable increase in the survival rate of their crews, and thus the success rate of their expeditions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This pendant bears the crest of an Aedyran patrician house to whom an unwanted child was born. The elf girl was cloistered within her chambers for most of her young life. She suffered terrible bouts of fits and hallucinatory fevers, to which her neglectful parents turned a blind eye. Her human stepmother, by way of &lt;i&gt;haemneg&lt;/i&gt;, had sympathy for the girl and cared for her almost exclusively. 

On reaching maturity the girl left to travel the countryside. She claimed her visions had begun to clarify, giving her a glimpse into the past, present, and future. She began to tell strikingly accurate fortunes for an ever-growing throng of followers. Her parents were mortified that their daughter had left her privileged station behind to become a vagabond mystic.

Eventually the girl's predictions turned into full-blown prophecy and proselytizing. It took little time for the local clergy to brand her a heretic. Her parents dispatched her human stepmother to confront their daughter and reclaim her family pendant, officially dissolving any connection to her. 

When the stepmother arrived at the prophetess' camp, the crowd parted for her as if by silent command. Her stepdaughter, having predicted her arrival, beckoned her into her tent. She knew why she had come. The next morning, the two had vanished. Only the pendant remained.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As punishment for his crimes, the mage and mass murderer Sisyfo was condemned by the Committee of Upright Study but spared execution due to unfavorable political repercussions. Instead he was imprisoned and sentenced to endlessly levitate a large stone above his head while alchemical potions eliminated his need for food, drink, or sleep. While the levitation demanded nothing from Sisyfo physically, it was mentally exhausting.

After many years of torment, Sisyfo's sister - the insane wizard Licyla - stormed the prison and set her brother free by driving the mythic Wedge of Wift into the stone, shattering it. She and Sisyfo escaped to continue their mad reign of terror and destruction, but not before collecting a shard of the stone. This amulet was made from that shard.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An odd confluence of alchemy and mechanical engineering, this blunderbuss once belonged to Xefa Bombardi, an Old Vailian pirate and noble. Xefa was not known for his savagery or ruthlessness, nor was he known for being a particularly successful pirate. Rather, he considered himself to be a "natural philosopher," rejecting the mysteries of the arcane in favor of rational, verifiable logic. He spent his years in the Deadfire aboard his personal frigate, tinkering with mechanical designs, experimenting with alchemical formulae, and writing innumerable treatises on the natural workings of the world. He looted and pillaged on occasion, but that was only a means to fund his various projects.

Piracy, even halfhearted piracy, was a dangerous side-profession, however, and Xefa had no illusions about it. This weapon served him well throughout the years and he never stopped fiddling with the design. As his mastery of alchemy and engineering improved, so did his favorite weapon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This unsavory weapon has changed hands too many times to have an accurate account of its origin. The most agreed-upon legend attributes a Dyrwoodan shepherd and frequent tavern patron with its initial creation, but even this yarn tends to be told with slurred, ale-soured words. The only things truly known about the dagger are the contents of its construction - the rent, twisted remnants of a cheap, brass beer stein - and the dreadful effect it has on both its wielder and its victims. Pukestabber seems to bring out the worst qualities of a mean drunk, and mean drunks seem to be the only people who have ever carried it, though rarely for long. Unsurprisingly, such individuals tend to misplace or gamble away the weapon with alarming regularity, though it is most commonly taken by force after a drunken row or pointless bar fight.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pirate known as Daneric the Bloody, captain of the Claret, carried this sword during a years-long campaign of murder and mayhem that took him from the seas of Aedyr to the shores of the White that Wends. He was indiscriminate in his violence, preying on merchants and other pirates alike in his quest for treasure and blood. 

The ships of his many victims were often discovered adrift, their decks littered with corpses and the riggings strewn with severed heads. Driven only by his insatiable need to spill blood, Daneric eventually began to forgo even plundering the vessels. As his infamy grew, entire flotillas set sail with the express purpose of hunting down the Claret and her captain.

Daneric’s crew, dissatisfied with a lack of loot and disillusioned with Daneric’s malevolent deeds, eventually sold him out to Vailian pirate hunters in exchange for clemency and a sizable bounty. When the Vailians boarded, Daneric’s crew turned on their captain.

Salvagers later discovered the Claret floating adrift. The headless bodies of both crews covered the deck. Neither the Vailian frigate nor Captain Daneric were anywhere to be found.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This sabre's origins are unknown, though it steel composition suggests it may have been forged in the White March. A retired Aedyran privateer named Tarn Baeris discovered the blade by happenstance in a ruined watchtower on his estate in the Eastern Reach. When the emperor recalled Tarn to service during the War of Defiance, he took the weapon with him.

Tarn, no longer a young man, was not enthusiastic about returning to sea, but he served the empire resolutely. He was tasked with interdicting Vailian corsairs who were shipping supplies to rebels in the Dyrwood. An honorable man, Tarn elected to spare the ships and crews he captured after relieving them of their cargo. As such, he rarely found a cause to draw his blade.

Tarn's largess would be his undoing, however. Within the year he was killed under a flag of parley while negotiating terms. The corsair who slew him took Tarn's sabre as a trophy.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aldris the Green, a humble blacksmith's apprentice, fashioned this beautiful sabre. The blade was polished steel and the basket hilt made from a jackdaw with feathers silky and black as jet. He presented it as a wedding gift to his betrothed - Liela, a druid of storms. 

On their wedding day, Aldris presented his beloved with the weapon. After the vows, Liela imbued the blade with the power of storms, etching her husband's name along the fuller in glowing green runes.

The celebration was short lived. Under a blackened sky the procession came under attack by the dreaded Captain Crow, commander of the Storm Raven, and his band of cutthroats. Liela attempted to defend her beloved, but she and Aldris were cut down. The buccaneers sacked the wedding and killed all who resisted. 

In the years that followed, Captain Crow used the blade of Aldris to cut a bloody swath through the Deadfire, killing and plundering, wielding the weapon's lightning with abandon. The sabre's powers, unchecked by its cruel wielder, eventually scorched the feathers and flesh from the jackdaw and stained the blade with its victims' blackened blood.</DefaultText>

She commanded countless sloops, ketches, and caravels over her career transporting valuable contraband and always insisted on flying her personal colors, which depicted a cat with a mocking grin. 

When her countless pursuers inevitably caught up to her, it only heightened her thrill. She enjoyed few things as much as honest swashbuckling. To that end she wielded this sabre in many fights and narrow escapes. While she was not overburdened with many personal possessions, she prized the blade, and cared for it lovingly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This ancient Huana weapon once belonged to the legendary barbarian Maoalahua the Battle Crazed. Known both for his love of violence and love of money, Maoalahua sold his services as a warrior to the highest bidder. He had no compunction against fighting on either side of a conflict and did so frequently, sometimes switching sides during a single battle. If he was rumored to be fighting, opposing commanders would actively bid for his loyalty throughout the course of the melee.

Maoalahua was indiscriminate in battle - striking all who came near, both friend and foe. He could be relied on to never give ground, however, and his "allies" always gave him a wide berth in which to do his deadly work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mestra Flaune Elette,

I feel I am on the very cusp of a breakthrough, but I have reached the limits of what I can accomplish with tools alone.

You yourself have had some fortune with locating volunteers. I hoped that, as your colleague, I might entreat you to make some small inquiries on my behalf. My needs being so specific, and myself having had few wholly positive interactions with the locals, I must confess that I am out of my depth. 

If you could simply spread the word that I am in search of test subjects - pregnant women, in particular - that alone would be of inestimable help. You may direct them to my room on the second floor of the tavern here in the Gullet. Per complanca, make them aware that I will compensate them for their time.

Maia declined to adorn the uniform with insignia or symbols of her rank, as such trappings often reveal the presence of officers to enemy marksmen.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Casità Samelia wore this breastplate while defending a ship of Darcozzi family dignitaries from a band of cutthroat pirates. In addition to a powerful warship and a bloodthirsty crew, the pirates also commanded a fearsome sea drake. Long-used to immediate capitulation in the face of such advantages, they were taken aback when the Darcozzi sloop, rather than heaving-to, came about, ready to fight. 

Sword in hand, Samelia called for ramming speed and boarding action. Her crew and small cadre of paladins were outnumbered but not outmatched. They valiantly took the fight to their attackers but lost all initiative when the pirate's drake entered the fray. Only Samelia stood against the beast. 

The enraged drake raked her across the breastplate, tearing it from her body and ripping steel and flesh. Mortally wounded, Samelia plunged her blade into the drake and pushed it back, forcing them both overboard. Her triumphant crew could only watch as their captain disappeared into the depths, her blade still embedded in the felled drake’s chest. On the deck, the paladin's ruined breastplate was all that remained of her.</DefaultText>

Ishiza wanted to defecate all over your dumb boat, but I told him to go overboard. Taught him better than that, but it seems you just bring out the worst in people. 

I want my stupid brother back.

Bruno was murdered in his bed. As a warning, his killers left the weapon that did the deed behind - this weapon. Armed only with the dripping blade and her broken heart, Juliena would go on to hunt down the killers and avenge her lover. Juliena's profitable new life as a bounty hunter became the stuff of legends. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This elegant great sword is of Aedyran manufacture. Emissaries from the Aedyr Empire presented it, along with seven similar weapons, to the first duc of the Free Palatinate of Dyrwood upon the conclusion of the War of Defiance. Intended as a gesture of peace, such a gift also signified de facto recognition of the Free Palatinate. The duc, pleased by acknowledgment of his rule, accepted.

As a gesture of solidarity with those who fought for Dyrwoodan independence, the duc distributed six of the weapons to his erls. The two Cavalier blades went to Helsgate and Coldwater. The Grasp and Norwaech received the Tower hammers. To Ashfall and Tenferths went the Abbot staves 

The two remaining great swords, Queen's Rule and King's Wrath, the duc ordered smelted down. In his words, the Free Palatinate no longer had any use for royalty. It seems this weapon was saved from the fire, though it has had a long fall from grace.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ogne, of the Partisans of the Lighted Path, had been carrying these documents on her person. 

One page appears to be a ship's itinerary, with a list of ports and dates. Hasongo and Neketaka are the last two ports listed. If the dates are correct, the ship would most recently have arrived in Neketaka. However, the itinerary does not specify a departure date for that entry - there is no telling if the ship has left port yet.

The second page is a list of names. "Bearn" does appear on it, about halfway down, with no surname listed.

There is also a cargo list, noting which cargo is to be picked up at each port. Food and drink account for most of the items being loaded at Neketaka, but one item stands apart as having no obvious place among the rest: "Venom, Aedyran Tree Viper." Its quantity is listed in terms of "phials," and calls for several dozen.

Finally, there is a map that appears to have charted places where Eothas has been sighted in the islands. A line has been drawn that connects the points. It projects a course northward beyond his most recent appearance, and a point along that trajectory has been marked with an 'x.'</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This cape is interwoven with copper thread and was created by an eccentric wizard to provide protection from electricity. The wizard's initial experiments were promising - the garment seemed to absorb and redirect the effects of the wizard's most potent lightning spells. After countless self-administered shocks he was left no worse for wear, save for a few burns and a persistent nervous twitch that intensified with his proximity to metal objects.

Ever a perfectionist, the enchanter was unsatisfied with his limited data. Simple spells were insufficient. He needed to pit the cape against the fury of a proper storm. When such a storm arrived, the wizard donned the cape and climbed to the spire atop his laboratory and called the lightning to himself. Seven lightning bolts struck the wizard simultaneously, throwing him from the spire to his sand garden below. There was a brilliant flash upon impact that turned the sand to glass and set his arboretum aflame. Broken and concussed, but very much alive, the enchanter praised his experiment as a resounding success.</DefaultText>

It should be nearing Fleet Week when this letter finds you, and I hope it finds you well. I regret that I'll not be there to hand-deliver it to you - you'll have to recite the Triumph of Tangaroha Over the Great God Korōpa without me.

My work in the archipelago will keep me away some few months yet. Don't despair, though - think of it as further opportunity to improve your hazatōha game. I've been working on mine, and I expect to finally find a worthy opponent in you when I return.

I trust you're keeping up your studies in weather magic. A couple years more, and you can join me in the navy. Perhaps, if all goes well here, I'll even have the clout to have you placed on my ship. We'd be the terror of the seas!

Give my love to father.

I am, as always, your doting sister,

      <DefaultText>The dhow has changed little since its inception in the days of Old Vailia, where it performed a variety of roles from fishing vessel to warship. Its triangular sails and sleek, efficient hull strike a balance between speed, maneuverability, and durability. Its armament, while modest, is quite capable of standing up to both faster and tougher vessels. Though the design has fallen out of favor in the Vailian Republics, the humble dhow has had a resurgence in Deadfire with the arrival of the Príncipi, who sail the craft with the skill and tenacity of their Old Vailian forbearers.

I would they had brought you here, where the priests could have seen to you. 
Still, I know that you are in Berath's hands. Who but they could have plucked you from the Shattered God's grasp? 

You have worked Berath's will in the past, and if that same will sends you to the far side of the sea, I trust you will fulfill your charge. 

I await your return. For years you and I have guided the people of Yenwood. There is still much work to be done.

Magnera faced the entirety of the prison garrison, fighting her way from the gates to the dungeon tower where the bailiff himself stood between the her and her husband's cell.

The two engaged in a ferocious duel of sabres. The warden, though skilled, was no match for Magnera. His many glancing blows failed to penetrate her chainmail. He could do nothing more than curse the outlaw's name as she cut him down.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This armor is made of cured deer leather of a most peculiar variety. A ranger harvested the skin from the carcass of a buck she discovered while poaching the woods of her lord's estate. The animal, quite dead, showed no signs of injury or disease. Grateful for her good fortune, the opportunistic ranger set about skinning and dressing it.

This proved impossible, though. As the ranger separated hide and sinew, she observed the deer's skin growing back before her very eyes. The ranger skinned and cut, collecting enough material to cover half-a-dozen animals, yet the carcass always regenerated to a pristine state.

Before she could investigate this seemingly endless source of flesh more closely, the ranger was driven off by the lord's game warden. She was able to carry only a fraction of the take she harvested. Later in her lodge she tanned and tooled what leather she had. This was no easy task, as any holes or punches closed themselves in minutes. Stitching was similarly arduous, but the ranger was eventually able to construct this strange, regenerative armor.</DefaultText>

Such a piece of armor is priceless to the people of the far plains and was likely as precious to the owner as his own horse. 

Small symbols have been etched into the lacquered lamellae. Some marks appear to be names while others seem to be protective runes or charms. Whether or not such wards proved effective for the nomad is impossible to determine, as is how such an exotic brigandine made its way to the Deadfire.</DefaultText>

Aye, there was loot aplenty. Found this brilliant little bronze horn, didn't I? Bound to fetch a fair price topside. 'Course, the moment I pulled it from the muck beside the corpse of some poor, rotted wretch, I hear this great moaning start up behind me. I jumped like a startled hare and ran for it. And here comes this shuffling, right, fast as anything, right on my heels. I kept running like Skaen's own effigy was chasing me, and it kept coming, and sure as shit I got lost.

Now I'm huddled in this old ruin hoping I've lost the damned thing. And if I haven't, well, I hope whoever's readin' this learns better'n me:

Azio Calmo was a man of cruel humor and dogged determination. The captain of the red-sailed sloop Cirono's Mercy, his own crew feared him as much as his foes, as Azio was as likely to inflict his sadistic punishments on underperforming underlings as the victims of his piracy. He survived four separate mutiny attempts, each time reversing the circumstances of an ambush and miraculously coming out on top. Legends spread of the wicked pirate captain with eyes in the back of his head, phenomenal reflexes, and a rapier the color of ink, made entirely of Ymyran steel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The woman who recently wore this shackle came from an enigmatic tribe of pale elves. Little is known about her people, save that at some point her village was sacked by roving slavers and she was taken to the Deadfire. Aboard the slave ship she was compliant but silent. Her captors were horrified to discover the woman's mouth had been wired shut, presumably as a child. Then she touched their minds.

&lt;i&gt;He travels southward. Watch the sky.&lt;/i&gt;

Uneased, the slavers fettered the woman's neck with an iron-adra shackle they reserved for captured ciphers and did their best to ignore her. When the ship arrived in the Deadfire, the slavers dropped anchor with several illicit merchant vessels to offload their kith cargo. When the woman was called to the auction block, she spoke to her imprisoners' minds despite the binding collar.

&lt;i&gt;Eothas nears. He will end it.&lt;/i&gt;

Then she vanished. All that remained were the shackle.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This dragon pendant is actually an intricately carved pipe of the type traditionally used to smoke whiteleaf. It is carved from what can only be a scale from the great adra dragon. Meticulous care was taken to fashion the wide, toothy mouth, which serves as the pipe's bowl. The small dragon seems to be both roaring and smiling, hungrily demanding to be packed and lit.

The pipe was the personal paraphernalia of Jehrelv the Addled, a wizard and animancer known not only for his love of whiteleaf, but also his obsession with its effects on the soul. His aloof and cruel nature led him to perform many questionable acts in his attempt to comprehend higher states of consciousness. He had a proclivity for stealing the souls of his associates and acquaintances, usually by inviting them to partake in poisoned potent whiteleaf. His victims would die and their souls, disoriented, would linger briefly. Jehrelv would then trap them in his favorite pipe. He always planned to conduct experiments on the souls of those who died in such a state, but often got distracted or just forgot.

Jehrelv came to a fitting end when, while not precisely in his right mind, he mistakenly smoked a batch of his own blighted whiteleaf and died. His spirit, confused, wandered into the pipe of its own volition, and has been unable to find its way out. It has plenty of company.</DefaultText>

When her creditors scoured her house for valuables, the ring was sitting on the entry table. A small scrap of parchment next to it bore Nikolya's handwriting. It appeared to have been torn from a larger volume, possibly a diary.

"...where the birds sing a pretty song," it read.

The band of this mysterious ring is of an unknown metal, but the stone set in its center is almost certainly jade. The gemstone bears an ancient pictograph depicting an owl. Paradoxically, the Engwithan word for "ibis" is embossed around the band. Donning the ring briefly fills the ears with the sounds of birdsong and running water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This ring is an heirloom of an Aedyran mercenary company, the Motherless Curs. Never a prestigious group, the mercenaries were not overburdened with any sense of loyalty, honor, or fair play. Each member endlessly plotted against the current commander, often claiming the position with a dagger to the back. Assuming command, the traitor would also acquire the ring as a symbol of rank. The ring was worn by fighters, barbarians, ciphers, and all other variety of people skilled in the art of violence. Each of them claimed the ring heightened their unique abilities with some sort of charm.

It was last seen worn by Haelion, a rogue operating in the Dyrwood. It is notable that Haelion had no known connection to the Curs. How he acquired the ring is unknown, but it is unlikely its former owner parted with it willingly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lethandria was the elf consort of Edwarth, a human lord of a prosperous Aedyran barony. Her marriage with her own elf husband was a cold one and produced no children. It was in Lord Edwarth's trueborn son, Matthew, that she found solace. She loved the boy as a son and cared for him after the passing of his mother, Edwarth's true wife. 

Matthew desired nothing more than to join the ranks of the knights of Aedyr, like his father, and trained as a squire from a young age. As he grew into a young man, he excelled in martial prowess and Aedyran virtue, eventually earning a command in the colony of the Dyrwood. The young captain became known for his bravery and evenhandedness in his protection of the empire's subjects. Esteemed with her surrogate son's accomplishments, Lethandria commissioned a shield worthy of his station, and Matthew wielded it with pride.

When the Dyrwood broke away from the empire, however, Lethandria was horrified to learn Lord Edwarth himself had been dispatched to put down the rebels along the borders. It seemed her precious Matthew had taken up the cause of the Dyrwoodans. After a long and bloody battle, Captain Matthew met his own father in single combat. Matthew's shield, shining in the moonlight, held true, but it was to no avail. The aspiring knight was cut down.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Endre was a monk dedicated to achieving perfection of body and mind. Contrary to traditional monastic beliefs which embraced pain, Endre believed pain was nothing but an illusion. It was merely a projection of weakness, and weakness had to be purged. He engaged in brutal self-flagellation as a catalyst for his transcendence, using this vicious flail for the bloody ritual.

His extreme practices were cautiously tolerated by his monastic brothers. However, when Endre declared himself first among equals and demanded the obedience of his fellow warriors, they immediately decried his fanaticism. Endre saw his first task as self-appointed leader would be to bring his wayward brothers to heel. If they would not bleed of their own volition, he would bleed them. 

The resulting melee was a bloody affair. It seemed Endre had indeed acquired great power through his suffering. Despite his wounds, his fellow monks were unable to match his prowess. The battle ended only when Endre was shot with several arrows. He died standing, his gore-covered flail still in hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tuotilo was a struggling metallurgist who supplemented his meager income by fighting in high-stakes boxing matches. Boxing proved to be the more lucrative venture and he eventually abandoned his forge to devote the entirety of his time to training and fighting. He proved to be quite skilled and quickly rose to prominence in the boxing circuit. He became so confident in his strength that he claimed his hands were strong enough to stop the blade of a sword. He even challenged the renowned duelist Ri Golan to a bout to prove his claim. During the fight, before a cheering crowd, Tuotilo lost his left hand to her sabre. 

A hard lesson learned, Tuotilo returned to his forge. Unwilling to admit his time as a master fighter had ended, he forged this impressive shield as a replacement for his missing hand. This new hand could not hold a hammer, but it could strike and parry, and that was good enough for him.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Long ago, Ganrich the great aumaua wayfinder sailed the far reaches of Eora, navigating only by the stars and tides. One night, while far out to sea, Ganrich was delighted to discover a storm of falling stars streaking through the night sky. One star, however, fell to ground on a nearby island, impacting with a blinding flash. Ganrich immediately ordered his crew to make for the island. 

The trees of the island burned like tinder and the sandy beach had been turned to glass. Once ashore, the explorer made his way to the island's center, which had been reduced to a smoldering pit. At the heart of the crater he discovered a stone unlike any other. Returning to his ship, Ganrich studied the rock. It was heavy, but fell slowly when tossed or dropped, and trailed blue fire while in motion. Where it landed it sparked, striking with mysterious force disproportionate to its speed. These properties made the stone uniquely suited to use as a smashing weapon. It was resistant to any tooling, however, so Ganrich instead fashioned it into this strange flail.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This blade seems to appear and disappear from history every generation or so. Many great nobles, warriors, and adventurers have carried it and accomplished great and terrible things with its power. Few are mentioned by name, almost as if they were an afterthought to the weapon itself. No owner is known to have retained the sword for long, as they have all invariably met their fate in violent ways. It is rumored that the sword sings a strange song to the hearts of those who wield it, inspiring them to push themselves to the edge of their abilities and beyond, rarely to a good end. Thus it has changed hands many times. 

Most recently it was recovered from the frozen corpse of a Vailian explorer in the White that Wends. He is said to have discovered the sword within the skeletal ribcage of a long-dead dragon along with the rusted remains of a suit of half-digested armor. Where or how the dragon's unfortunate victim acquired the weapon is unknown, though it can be reasoned he came about the blade in a similar macabre fashion.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Long before the founding of the Aedyr Empire, the tribal lords of the Aedyr Kingdom pledged their service to the fercönyng, the "first king." One such king, Bronlar, also served as a theater general. He led an elite detachment of pikemen known as the Thorned Wall. Unlike the fercönyng's personal guard unit, the Tall Grass, Bronlar's soldiers had little use for the trappings of ceremony. They needed only their shields and spears.

When conflict with the Kulklin bloomed into war, Bronlar received word of enemies marching on the strategically vital bridge at Skerbaen. With no time for dispatches he marched with his single phalanx to hold the crossing. There his force was met by a horde of hostile warriors on the opposite bank. Outnumbered at least five-to-one, Bronlar issued a single imperative. 

"None shall cross."

The Thorned Wall never gave an inch even as they began to fall. Casualties mounting, Bronlar knew his shield wall could not hold forever, so he ordered his men to withdraw and burn the bridge. The warrior king was last seen holding off the advancing enemy force singlehandedly, even as the flames enveloped him. His shield, blackened but unbroken, was later recovered. It now serves as symbol of Aedyran courage and commitment to duty.</DefaultText>

Most of these peasant soldiers fought in battle lines equipped with little more than farming implements and improvised armor. A few of the bravest and strongest footmen, however, were selected to serve in the anti-cavalry companies. Outfitted with better armor and long, two-handed hammers, these troops were tasked with supporting Dyrwoodan knights in their battles with the capable Readceran heavy cavalry.

This humble war hammer was once the weapon of such a soldier. While in better repair, it could unhorse an armored rider with a single blow to the breastplate, breaking steel and bone. At some point it was cut or smashed in half, likely followed by its wielder. A brief, poorly-spelled message is scratched into the haft. 

It reads, "I m Ulstors weapn n ail shut yur muth." 

The crude legend served as some sort of charm for the unfortunate Ulstor. Perhaps the magic still has some use left.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Forged through ritual sacrifice, this sword radiates the hot, metallic scent of fear and the singed sulfur smell of anger. When you hold it, you taste blood on your tongue and hear the whispered cries of the soul fragment trapped within.

The enchanted blade seems almost to guide its own motions, hungrily seeking out flesh to cut. It is a greedy thing with an unquenchable thirst, and once it draws blood, it is loath not to sup on the sweet, spilling essence within.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Shining Bulwark originated as the common shield of a guard captain of Old Vailia. While escorting her master and his delegation of nobles to negotiate with political dissidents in one of the colonies, the captain received word that the people of the region had risen in revolt, declaring themselves free of Old Vailia. The entire city descended into chaos as populist rebels took to the streets against the few loyalist defenders. The captain suddenly found herself and those under her protection in hostile territory, surrounded by enemies eager for their blood. 

Wasting no time, the captain organized her small force of house guards and led them towards the harbor, where a loyalist ship waited to evacuate her masters to the safety of Old Vailia. Beset by a mob of angry rebels, they fought through the streets and kept their shields between the rioters and their masters. Upon reaching the harbor, the guard captain made a desperate last stand as her fellows and masters boarded the last ship out of the port. Those aboard later recalled watching the captain battle the furious multitude, her shield glowing like the sun.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This round shield was crafted by Orvyn, an Aedyran blacksmith after his son, Nerian, informed him of his decision to leave home to follow a life of adventuring. Unable to dissuade his son, Orvyn intended to make sure Nerian would carry something with which to defend himself from the many dangers he would surely encounter. 

Orvyn worked for weeks, painstakingly assembling the finest shield he had ever constructed. The blacksmith could not afford expensive wood or fancy leather. Even the rivets were of humble iron. The quality of the craftsmanship however, and the care which Orvyn poured into the shield, made it into something greater than the sum of its parts. It was the last gift Nerian would receive from his father, who passed away only several weeks after his departure. 

Nerian would survive his adventures, eventually retiring to his family home where he took up the smithy's hammer for himself.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina had followed her orders from the ducs bels, helping to establish an exclusive trade arrangement between the Vailian Republics and the tribes of Eir Glanfath. Strengthened by the Watcher's gift of souls, the furious Dyrwoodans waged war against the Republics for two long years. The Republics gained a great deal of wealth in trade but suffered the loss of many vessels and thousands of lives. Several of the ducal families lost favor with their citizens. Riots in Selona claimed the life of that city's duc, and the other ducs bels were pressured into relinquishing the exclusive trade rights to end the conflict with the Dyrwood. Pallegina was honored for her service at the opening of trade. Thankfully her reputation among the ducs and within the Brotherhood was not tarnished by what followed.

Pallegina continued to proudly wear her breastplate, which declares her loyalty to the Brotherhood, the ducs, and the Republics.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aedhor Maydr, a Dyrwoodan thayn, was fond of his pack of hounds. His favorite was Wicked Beast, a most ill-tempered and half-blind mongrel. She would snap at everyone, including her master, and her will could not be bent like the other dogs. Wicked Beast would bite any creature in her vicinity. Such was her belligerence that Aedhor took to wearing a thick glove to pet the hound. 

Even as the hound aged her temper never waned, though her health diminished. Near the end she lacked the strength to do more than muster a pitiful snarl. Aedhor knew her days were numbered. He tasked an animancer to transfer the dog's soul into an ashwood pike to preserve her bestial, untamed essence.

Much of Wicked Beast's soul was lost to the process, though the weapon holds her essential nature. It is a temperamental item, likely to strike at its wielder as their enemies. Its power and aggression, however, are undeniable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This shield was constructed for the use of an Engwithan saint as he performed his eternal vigil. Crafted from a single slab of adra, Cadhu Scalth - "the Saint's Protection" - is a natural reservoir for soul energy and lent considerable power to the vessel who bore it. The saint was parted from his shield only when the volcano over which the sacred site he guarded erupted. 

The shield was recovered many years later by a band of Roparu woodsmen where it was half-submerged in a quickmud pit. The Roparu, none of whom grasped the value of the find, retrieved it for curiosity's sake. The shield was no more than a novelty until it began to "sing," as the woodsmen described it. They recounted to their chieftain that the dissonant melody hummed with "luminous colors" that revealed their lives past and shook them to their core. The chieftain, unwary of the implications of such tales, took the shield for his personal use.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The line of succession in a Huana tribe is malleable to change. One trend remains constant - Mataru warriors possessing strength, leadership, and wisdom make a natural choice for rangas. The Kahanga diverged from this pattern centuries ago. Instead of choosing from accomplished fighters or hunters, the Kahanga look to the most intellectual and tactical Mataru-born.

Recent Kahanga generations have embraced this uncommon practice by favoring ciphers in their leadership. Some believe the development to be in reaction to the spread of foreign influence in the Deadfire, but the tradition stretches farther than most credit. Onekaza II, latest of the cipher rangas, seems determined to not be the last of the cipher rangas as she clings to diminishing Huana sovereignty in the region. 

Rising where other tribes floundered, the Kahanga are praised for keen political maneuvering and endurance in the face of relentless trials. All that remains to be seen is how much one cipher can endure.</DefaultText>

Artillery foundries developed this cannon for naval use, as fire is particularly dangerous aboard a ship. Primed with a concentrated mixture of Magran's Breath and runepowder, the gun fires cannonballs wreathed in flame. This prototype has inferior range to most shipboard guns, but up-close it is capable of setting entire decks, riggings, and crews alight with nigh-unquenchable flame.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This type of cannon came to prominence during the Saint's War, where Dyrwoodan forces used it to great effect combating the Readceran invasion. It is inexpensive to construct, lightweight, and reliable. The short, broad barrel earned its nickname from Lord Commander Sigfryd Rulth of the Dyrwoodan Overland Regiment at the battle of Char's Field, where he and his soldiers - nearly all of them commoners - made a valiant stand against the invaders. He is famously quoted, "There is nothing more stubborn than a Dyrwoodan farmer fighting for his home, save perhaps our hog nose guns." 

Easily converted to use as a shipboard weapon, the hog nose is nonetheless inferior to dedicated naval guns, as its range is limited. Its light weight, however, is advantageous to a ship's overall speed and maneuverability.</DefaultText>

&lt;i&gt;Left my home and lover dear&lt;/i&gt;

We had a letter from Aedyr givin' plunderin' rights
&lt;xg&gt;Dyrwood&lt;/xg&gt; ships were up for a fight
&lt;i&gt;Godsdamn them once and damn them twice
Lord Darryn promised gold and glittering prizes&lt;/i&gt;

We set sail headin' &lt;xg&gt;Dyrwood&lt;/xg&gt;-bound
Two weeks at sea and a rebel we found
&lt;i&gt;We were brave young fools and surely mad
We couldn't be stopped we were Darryn's Lads&lt;/i&gt;

Lord Darryn called for ramming speed
Draw your blades said he, let's make 'em bleed
&lt;i&gt;I miss my home and lover dear&lt;/i&gt;

We closed and crashed and leapt aboard
Bled them more than they could afford
&lt;i&gt;Godsdamn them once and damn them twice
Lord Darryn promised gold and glittering prizes&lt;/i&gt;

Lord Darryn with his voulge fought true
Wrought thunder and sparks and led us through
&lt;i&gt;We were brave young fools and surely mad
We couldn't be stopped we were Darryn's Lads&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This one's better than the rest. When they hold me, it almost feels real, like the way things used to be. Joy, bright and buoyant, that grows with every swing, with every slick splash of hot blood across my blade. It almost feels right. I almost feel like... me. But I'm not me without her, am I, and what did she do? She left me behind. Abandoned me.

This one will, too.

We were good at first. A real team. The way we fought - it wasn't the same as it was with Yngfrith, but it wasn't bad, either. There was a fire between us, and it roared when we killed. I felt... alive. Like things might be okay. That this one might not leave me after all.

But that fire died. What if it doesn't return?

      <DefaultText>We found Yngfrith. I still can't quite believe it. She was there in Dunnage, just like she said she'd be. She &lt;i&gt;apologized&lt;/i&gt;. I never thought she'd do that. But when she held me again... it didn't feel the same. Didn't feel like it used to. Was I a fool to think it'd be just like it was between us?

I wanted her to take me back. Even if things weren't like they were, even if they had to be different. But then I remembered the Watcher's warm hands and the feeling of splitting a beast from neck to navel. I remembered how &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; never left me behind, and- and then I wanted to stay with them, too.

So, I let the Watcher decide - let me go with Yngfrith or keep me for themselves. And they chose me. They chose &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. And I'm happy? But no, that's not it. It's...

I'm not scared anymore.

      <DefaultText>Wrought of fine steel and engraved with gilded Eld Aedyran runes that read MODWYR, this blade would have been a fashionable Dyrwoodan noble's favored accessory twenty years ago. Time has been rather unkind to it, however. The delicate filigree relief in its pommel has been scored by accident and violence, and the tightly wound leather of its hilt is stained with patches of old blood. For all that, the blade itself is sharp, though what warmth it once held is gone.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Excerpt from &lt;i&gt;On the Fire-Forged Path: the Travels of Gjaryc Yltan&lt;/i&gt;.

"Though I was born and raised a Magranite - and a Magranite, now, I will stay - as a young man I undertook a pilgrimage to visit a holy house dedicated to every god. In so doing, I hoped to know them each the better, to take what they had to teach and sow it into my soul like so many seeds, that my soul might grow and bear only the most delectable fruit for my goddess to devour at the moment of my death. So it is with no small amount of amusement that I pen this account of my visit once to a church of Wael, the many-eyed, many-tongued god of dreams and secrets, revelations and mysteries, and reveal to you all I learned there.

The challenge came first in finding adherents to Wael's doctrine, for they are not often ones to announce their presence, preferring instead to build their flock from the solitary seekers who delve through ancient ruins and ruined archives in search of the strange, the bizarre, the forgotten. But persistence is my goddess' first teaching, and find them I did.

The Waelites' Neketakan congregation was small then, as it likely remains now, and on the morning I stumbled upon them, they were lounging like so many cats in the sun on the steps above Queen's Berth, sharing between them a bottle of arrack and pipes packed with whiteleaf and ripple sponge. I knew them for Waelites not for any badge or robe or trinket they wore, not for their race or age, but for the ardor of their debate on the most benign of topics.

I begged that they take me to their church and permit me to worship with them, and they laughed as one, their many voices like the howling of wild dogs. They acquiesced when I told them of my quest, and then invited me to sit and share their drink. I did, and as the arrack burned a trail of fire down my throat, they showed me the dimensions of their hall of worship. The stairs were their pews, they said, the blue sky their ceiling, and their walls the edges of the world. All of creation sits within its bounds.

As morning neared midday, they stood as one and began to climb the mountain. 'Where do you go now?' I asked. 'To worship!' They replied. A great wave of relief washed over me, for at last I would have my lesson from them. We climbed the many steps of Neketaka and arrived at last in the Sacred Stair. 'Where is your temple?' I asked, and in response they whooped like children, rushing past me in a squall of smoke and laughter. I followed as best I could, though I wet my good slippers in a stream and could hardly keep my feet on the moss-slick stones, and we surged soggy-footed and hollering into the Temple of Gaun.

'To worship! To worship!' They cried. We shoved past Dawnstars bent in praise of their macabre god, laughing all the while, and came to stand before a leafless tree whose boughs were hung in lanterns too numerous too count. I had nary a moment to catch my breath before the Waelites were clambering into the great tree's branches. A young man pulled me up with one hand and handed me a pipe with the other. The priests of Gaun screeched and wailed, and all the while we squawked like birds, our smiles wide and eyes alight with arrack and lantern fire. The Mataru came soon after to chase us away, but not before we'd done our share of singing to the many-eyed, many-tongued god of dreams.

Would that I could have stayed with them a while longer, but alas, I could not deny my soul its journey nor the whispers of my goddess in my ear. I took again to the road in search of churches, but I must admit, I longed always after for that tree."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A small, oilskin-wrapped letter lay with the arquebus in the grave. The penned letters are blocky and deliberate.

"Well, now you've done it, fool. I don't know if you be a graverobber or just an opportunistic knacker, but you've stepped into a mess in either case. You found the gun, and I don't suppose anything I write here will convince you to put it back where you found it. So be it. Listen, and listen well.

There be dark places in certain forests where souls linger after death. Hangman trees, quicksand mires, deadfalls, and the like - places where people met their end. The mênpŵgra find these places, hungry for the soul energies. I seen them. It was my job to clear them out of the woods, them and other monsters, and I was damn good at it. Good enough to become prideful - and foolish.

I killed me a big one, a mênpŵgra matriarch. A mean bitch, she was, cruel and hungry. Thought I'd make her into a trophy. Took her twisted, wooden heart out and fashioned a new tool of my trade."

There's a blank area at the bottom of the letter, as if some of the text is missing.</DefaultText>

"The gun was a fine one, as you can surely attest. Shot true and served me well. But it weren't me it served, do you ken? Took me a while to notice it, the change. My fingernails went black, teeth yellowed. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. Still, I hunted - &lt;i&gt;had&lt;/i&gt; to hunt, you see. 

Every beast I slew fed the heart. She was in there, I reckon, the mênpŵgra, using me in stay of her own body to collect souls and spread her rot. Insatiable, she was."</DefaultText>

"You'd be surprised how long a body can ignore real sickness. I told myself it would pass, even as my teeth fell out of my head and my hair, by then green as moss, withered. Was it me the bitch was eating, one piece of my soul at a time?

Couldn't be, I told myself. Stronger than ever I was, still a crack shot, still able to do my duty. I was just getting up there in years, I said. If I kept the woods safe using the matriarch's spoiled magic, then the joke was on her, ken it?

It be when the village crops started dying off, I took notice. When the cattle thinned with blight. When the sickness started, and mothers wept. By the gods, what a fool I'd been. And still, the heart was hungry."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The final entry is difficult to read. The letters twist and tremble.

"So, I took it away, the gun. Took it as far away from the village as I could, chartered a ship and sailed south.

She knew what I was planning, for certain. The heart didn't take kindly to me interrupting her meal, and she turned on me. The rot quickened, and I withered like a severed vine, shrinking in on myself. The crew of the vessel took sick. The timbers of the ship turned black with mold and began to leak. We ran aground here, as good a place as any. The crew be dead and the ship no good to me. 

I buried the heart where it couldn't hurt nobody. Then you come along and dig it up. As I said, I be long-gone by now, and I can't stop you. If you be intent on taking the gun, so be it. Just remember, my foolish friend - the heart always be hungry. You'd best feed it regular, lest it look to you."</DefaultText>

I hear you've got a deal (another one, really?) going on with Furrante to muck around in the mess that is Crookspur Island. Before you go sailing in to do that cock-rot's bidding, come and have a chat with me, will you? I've got a proposition for you I think you'll find wickedly enticing.

I'll reserve a berth for [Player Ship] at Fort Deadlight's docks.

      <DefaultText>Captain,

I have my gripes with the navy from time to time, but I know we're here to do good work. Wish I could say the same about you. 

Some day you might learn what it means to be a part of something important. You'll probably get yourself killed long before that revelation takes hold, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. You have a knack for survival that I admire.

You're more than your busted up castle and twisted soul. You have the chance to be something incredible. The sooner you realize this, the sooner you can get to work on making Eora a better place with the rest of us. 

Best of luck,
~Maia Rua

      <DefaultText>Excerpt from the diary of an unnamed pirate about the lost vessel Fisher Queen.

"'The sea is every inch Ondra's blood, every inch her tears, and though it be Amira's breath what moves us through it, it's only by Ondra's will we don't drown in her holy viscera. Court her wrath at your peril, 'cause she don't know the meaning of mercy.'

An old-timer told me that on my first time out of port, and that crusty bastard never knew when to quit flapping him gums, so I never believed a word he said. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; never saw the goddess herself rise up out of the depths and put her watery hand to a vessel. The winds and waves - those were &lt;i&gt;earthly&lt;/i&gt; threats. The gods got better shit to do than torment us.

'Course, that was all 'fore I started shipping aboard the &lt;i&gt;Fisher Queen&lt;/i&gt;.

Wreck of a man found me in the Mare in Neketaka - one eye, scars all up 'n down his face, a real pirate's pirate. Sidled up to me at the bar like we were old friends. 'Look like you know yer way about some rigging,' he said. Thought he was trying to pick me up at first, and I nearly let him do it. Instead, he laughed. 'Got my eye on some special game,' he said, 'and we're gonna need the best there is to bring it down.'

Now, I don't give two half-shits about prestige. Pump up my ego all you want - what kind of coin you offering? Well, he was offering good coin indeed. So, I went with him. Dumb fucking thing to do, but what did I know? Nothing. Not a gods damned thing. That's clear as the morning to me now.

We were hunting maidens. Maiden-flesh, really. Wasn't a delicacy nowhere, but my new friend, the one-eyed sailor, was aiming to make it one. Start a craze. Cash in. Buy a nice little island out from under the locals and spend his remaining days laid out on a black sand beach with a jug of palm wine in the crook of one arm and a ready lover in the other.

Now, you hear &lt;i&gt;stories&lt;/i&gt; about those beasts. We all hear stories. Sailors lured to their deaths by the maiden of the depths and her handmaidens, unable to resist the beauty of their mournful song. Sounds like bullshit, doesn't it?

We found a pack out near the Ofecchia Channel, hunting tuna. They had the look of handsome ladies from a distance - tails long as a stormy night and slick as a salt-drenched deck, hair like seaweed with wide, comely smiles. So, we netted a few and dragged them on deck. Wasn't even hard. It was like they wanted to be caught.

They hissed and screamed as we readied our knives, and too soon we realized our mistake. We discovered their rows of serrated shark's teeth and unhinged jaws when one of them swallowed Yaryc whole, and we learned too late about the poisoned barbs on their hips when Gavril grappled with a pair and started vomiting up chunks of congealed black blood. And the glitter in their sclera-less eyes, dark blue and deep as Ondra's own void, I came to know when one took my right arm clean off at the elbow.

As if that wasn't grim enough, that night, the Lady of Lament got her revenge on the &lt;i&gt;Fisher Queen&lt;/i&gt; for our transgression - we lost our mainmast, all our fresh water, and four men overboard in a storm the likes of which I haven't seen since. We drifted for a week before a Vailian merchant ship found us.

And the great irony of it all was... the maidens tasted like shit."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>5212</ID>
      <DefaultText>Excerpt from a lecture given before the annual convention of the academy of architectural historians in Aedyr.

"Close examination by learned parties suggests that Neketaka is significantly older than it might at first appear.

We take as our example the suppurating wound in the city's side, which the locals most charmingly refer to as 'the Gullet.' On its face, it is not considerably different from your average slum. Indeed, it contains all that one might expect of such a place - desperate poverty, wrenching hunger, a tavern fair brimming with miscreants, and a flourishing criminal culture. Of course, it has its own unique offering, as well - a towering pile of garbage dumped into the district from the more affluent neighborhoods above it. It is, in every sense, abominable. The Huana leadership should be ashamed.

But I digress. Far more interesting than the caste stratifications among the Huana are the bones their city is built upon - for beneath 'the Gullet' lies a vast cavern littered with the remains of an ancient city. Referred to simply as the 'Old City' by the denizens of Neketaka, this sunken metropolis is notable for two reasons - the Old City's architecture is markedly different in style, form, and apparent use from the architecture of modern Neketaka, and there is no readily available explanation for the Old City's destruction that has not already been considered and discounted by those inclined to study it.

My peers here in the academy and beyond believe that the Old City's destruction is clearly the fault of the region's energetic volcanism and subsequent tectonic rumblings. I would caution against grasping at such easy solutions, however.

Consider the following -

The Huana have lived in the region for thousands of years. Earthquakes are no more a surprise to them than are the archipelago's daily soaking rains. None in Eora match their sheer creativity and expertise in building to withstand these events.

Moreover, for all their flexibility in building construction, the Huana's tastes have proven to be remarkably stable over time, showing a clear preference for designs that mimic the rhythm and shapes of the natural world. The Old City shows none of these things. Indeed, what remains was constructed primarily of stone cut in austere blocks, and the buildings are arranged in a manner not dissimilar from those prevalent in the Engwithan ruins that dot the landscape.

With those two points in mind, does it not seem prudent to ask whether the Old City is Huana in origin and, if it is not, who built it, and, finally, what destroyed it?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>5214</ID>
      <DefaultText>Excerpted from &lt;i&gt;Nothing is Lost&lt;/i&gt;, the collected journals of Wanamora Wave-Chaser.

"The ranga's men came to collect my portion of prize-share this morning, and I had nothing to give them again. I make no money for the tribe, though I am always in my little ferryboat, &lt;i&gt;Grey Gull&lt;/i&gt;, carving through the waves. At night, I get no sleep. Whaitaro asks me to conserve the lamp oil, to come to bed, but I can't, not until I find it.

I know it's out there. The lost city of Ukaizo. On every chart and map of the Deadfire I've found, whether Huana, Vailian, or Ruautaian, there is a gap. An empty space where so much of our history should be.

Did it burn to ash and cinders in the cataclysm? Did it sink below the waves? Does Ngati clutch it to her breast at the bottom of the sea?

Perhaps it's lost and wandering, like me. Unmoored. Looking for a home it can't remember, but for which some insistent longing burns in its chest, an ember always smoldering, a little fire to push it on.

Whaitaro wants me to give it up. But how can I? On mornings when the sky is so clear I can hardly catch my breath for the beauty of it, I think I see it out there, shimmering in the brightening blue light. Is it a taunt or a beckoning? Would I be able to tell the difference?

I ask the fisherfolk when they return with their catch at sunset. 'Tibere,' I say, 'did you see anything? Or you, Mabori? How about you, Puira?' They avoid me now. Whaitaro says they're busy, but I know they think I'm tide-sick and sun-addled. The way Puira's lip curls in disgust when I approach, the way Tibere's eyes seem to see right through me. I know.

They won't have to suffer me much longer, because tomorrow I'm taking &lt;i&gt;Grey Gull&lt;/i&gt; and sailing north.

Someone has to chase the old tales.

So I will."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This ring was the prized possession of Mikael Malloy, an orlan Bleak Walker of the Eastern Reach. He was a solitary man and preferred to work alone whenever possible. His compatriots rarely objected. Few of them could stomach Malloy's presence for any prolonged period. To anyone present he was a crude, cruel, and generally unlikeable soul, even by the brutal standards of the Bleak Walkers.

Malloy spoke at length of the countless foes he had bested, great beasts felled, and those he had crushed under his boot. If he was to be believed, the gods themselves trembled at his name. While few, if any, believed his rambling tales, none could deny that the orlan was a hardy bastard and had survived on his own through many lesser conflicts. 

After retiring, Malloy settled in the Dyrwood and lived a quiet, comfortable life. His many rivals and enemies, however, had not forgotten him. A few brief weeks into retirement, his body was discovered in his washroom. His neighbors, hardly surprised, testified to the bailiff that Malloy must have accidentally cut off his own head while shaving. Nothing had been stolen, save for his ring.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A Recent History of Queen's Berth: The Arrival of the Vailians</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>5221</ID>
      <DefaultText>Excerpted from a letter by Winge Wharaki, a Huana historian, from a collection of her personal writings.

"The Vailians' arrival in Neketaka was not unexpected. Our fisherfolk had watched them lurk near the edges of our territory for months, their ships like the keen eyes of a jeweler, inspecting us, already counting the coin they'd make on a prize so fine as the Deadfire. They were not the first to watch us so - doubtless they will not be last.

We were not certain what it was they wanted, at first, aside from whatever it was we had. When Onekaza sent an envoy of Mataru to speak with the them, they made noise about desiring trade and cultural exchange. What, exactly, it was they intended to trade, or what manner of cultural exchange they thought might entice u,s wasn't immediately clear.

We were not naïve - we knew their arrival spelled change for the Deadfire as surely as we know that rain falls in the monsoon season. The trouble came in how we would manage the Vailians' influence, how we would &lt;i&gt;contain&lt;/i&gt; it. Better they think us partners than easy marks, the thinking at the palace went at the time. We could not risk war with them, as fractured a people as we are, and have any hope of winning it, no matter the power of our watershapers.

As the leader of the Kahanga, Onekaza decided for us. She allowed the Vailians to set down roots in Queen's Berth and begin limited mining operations in the archipelago. She suggested this might ease trade and tensions between our people and theirs, but, in truth, I believe she only wanted to keep an eye on them. I sympathize with her point of view, but I cannot endorse it, because Onekaza forgot the truth of roots - that they are the silent, grasping hands of trees, and that a tree once established cannot be moved without destroying the ground around it.

But it was done. The Vailians quickly made themselves at home, and the ensuing conflict over who had rights to which islands, which adra veins, which trading routes only served to fracture the Huana further.

Then the Rauataians arrived.

By that point, it was too late. The colonials were in the Deadfire to stay. Now Huana refugees flood into Neketaka from across the archipelago, complaining of lost land and dwindling resources, and the trading companies fight a quiet war against each other with our doorsteps as the front.

Ngati guide us in this trying time."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Guns such as these are deployed in great numbers along the Aedyran Straights of Jölska, where numerous coastal forts defend the network of waterways from pirate raiders and enemy ships. It is a more complicated device than its Dyrwoodan contemporaries and takes longer to reload but can engage targets at much longer range. While not designed for use aboard ships, the gun has proven a capable maritime weapon in the Deadfire nonetheless.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The naval engineers of Rauatai developed this twin-barreled naval gun in an effort to maximize the number of guns a ship could carry. While both barrels fire relatively small shot, the combined impact of both projectiles produces damage no single-barreled weapon can match. The weapon has limited range and is laborious to reload, even for a trained gun crew, but its effects are devastating. Adjusting aim with the gun is time-consuming, so it is generally calibrated to fire at a fixed distance, which requires a target to be within a narrow optimum range.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Taken from the halls of Durgan's Battery, this dwarven cannon was never intended for use on the high seas. It fires heavy iron shot over a vast distance and, in the hands of a skilled gunnery crew, is capable of inflicting great damage to enemy ships. The efficient dwarven design utilizes a unique gun carriage, necessary to support the weapon's prodigious bulk. Despite its cumbersome ammunition, the cannon's precisely engineered designed provides for relatively speedy loading.</DefaultText>

      <ID>5234</ID>
      <DefaultText>This fragile tablet was painstakingly etched in Engwithan runes several thousand years ago.

"The festival lanterns shine with a warm, yellow glow tonight, bobbing on the light breeze from the sea. The young folk dance, feet stamping and smiles bright, a feverish joy alight in their eyes. The old folk drink and tell tales of years long past, their laughter loud enough to shake the very adra beneath our feet. And the children for whom we do this, our future - they steal sweets from the banquet tables, they wrestle and tease and fight as children ought, and my soul swells with pride.

Together we celebrate the end of our work and look forward to new beginnings, a shining horizon where we Engwithans and our Huana brethren labor as one for the glory and illumination of all kith. Tonight, Poko Kohara, our masterpiece, sits resplendent, a testament to all that our cultures have striven toward, all that we might gain.

And yet, even if our calculations are sound and our construction sturdy - if the machine works as intended - it will be but one small step along the twisting road we must walk together. But if we can harness the power of souls, if we can control the cycle of life and death... the journey will be worth it, no matter how arduous or how long.

Ah, but now is not the moment for questions of philosophy. Tonight, we join hands and sing! And tomorrow- tomorrow, our work of generations begins. At last, it begins."</DefaultText>

"I found my spine on the Deadfire Lines,
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
From a Dyrwood babe to a sailor fine,
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Now Deadfire routes they make good time
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
With the clear wide straits, and inlets fine
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Oh they're the lines where you can shine
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
They're the lines where I spent my prime
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Just take a trip to Port Maje
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
To Port Maje where the sailors stay
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Then Vailian captains you'll see there
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
With their knee-high boots, and fine dark hair
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Oh around Cape White to Port Maje
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
Oh around Cape White is a damn long way
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Around Cape White with a sky sail set
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!
Around Cape White and we’re ringing’ wet
Hoorah for the Deadfire Lines!

Well if we drown when we are young

It’s better to be drowned than hung

While crossing down Deadfire way

They say in Deadfire the luminous grows
Heave-ho, Aim'Spirente!

To make our fortunes one day.

The next day on sail we back with cheers,
Heave-ho, Aim'Spirente!
On Spirento fair, we'll see our dears

Hold fast the course, hold fast the waves

      <DefaultText>An excerpt from the journal of Noran, former First Mate of the Tempest Turn. It reeks of stale liquor and whiteleaf smoke.

"Day 286

Suppose this is more of a diary now (though let's be honest, it was heading that course for some time now) on account of Captain Deluna kicking me from the ship. And all because I kept reminding her how she said one night over dinner she'd finally listen to my theories on that crew who went missing near some island - (what was it called, Bloodlung Island or Kazuwari or something such?) - to the north of Fort Deadlight. I don't remember. Point is, I know it wasn't the Floating Hangman what got them cause the dhow was recovered and it didn't have no blood on the deck nor even any torn sails or pockmarked wood. For that matter, it couldn't have been those trading company bastards, ship hunters, slavers, Huana savages, or aumaua military.

The crew just up and disappeared. Every last one. No bodies. No blood. Just clothes and food and grog left behind. Gods, THEY LEFT THE GROG! Every last cask.

So you tell me, Captain Deluna, just what happened to them? What new threat's out there what we ought to be spending gold and rubies and blood and sweat to prepare for?!

Who took them if it wasn't a flock of overly cunning imps with the taste for pirate flesh?

Well, I'm going to find out. Just as soon as I charter a ship to that island."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An excerpt from a hulking tome several inches thick penned by one Reygnfar Carnet, who warns his readers against the negative consequences of consuming fiction.

"If there exist lands beyond the churning tempest of Ondra's Mortar, none have lived to tell of them. Yet, rumors persist in sailor tales and merchant fables of a storm-lashed continent where dust and sand drift high as mountains and crawl across the land like a searing river. Horses are said to run wild there, ridden by a fire-haired people who stand ten, sometimes twenty feet high, and whose voices boom as loudly as calving glaciers across their great sand sea. The stories say they do not fight amongst themselves, but raise their voices only in greeting, so mollified are they by the careful attentions of the gods, who dote upon them above all others.

What are we to make of such stories? They are nonsense, of course, tall tales spun to delight the simple minds of children and sailors alike. Indeed, tales such as this one and others of its ilk tell us more about ourselves than they do a mythical people on a mythical land halfway across the world. We dream of sand because we are awash in water, hemmed in on every side. We long for peaceful giants because we feel ourselves small and sow little more than discord between us. We say, wistfully, that they are beloved of the gods because we do not feel the loving touch of the gods upon our &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt; heads, so we must then seek comfort in the knowledge that it is only because they love another of their children more that they ignore us."</DefaultText>

For what did you send me away to meditate on the Fourth Form in uncharted waters only to summon me back to the Kahanga fleet? A bomb must have gone off in Serpent's Crown - one of revelation if not black powder. 
The interruption is a setback. I trust that whatever happens next will propel our people forward? I will sail Periki's Resolve into the waters where I suspect you need me most and await your orders. I hope that the rumors carried upon the waves are to be trusted. 
I would tell you to send Onekaza my love, but she knows that it is hers. Tell her that she needs only snap her fingers and I will be her storm again.

I have warned Kamauka against calling rain over the outsider forts, but still she delights in rusting their weapons and muddying their soil, which tells me that someone must have put her up to this trickery. Someone she trusts. 
She admires you, my prince, but I say that she is a storm you cannot control. Onekaza will not thank you for prodding the eel's den. You have given enough faith to trickster Ngati, now take Amira's example and await the hatching of the egg. 
The turbulent skies speak of change and upheaval. I say let them come, but save your strength for the day the skies open. 
I have recommended that Kamauka seek you out. There is a place for her in the fleet if you find yourself in need of Amira's sharpened beak. 

For the isles,

This letter should reach the Brass Citadel long before I do. Which is lucky for you, because you'll need the time to make some hazatōha winnings to settle our last bet.

Never challenge a captain of the Ruquapa choro kernel spitting contest.

My eldest knitted a pair of those fancy socks you love. Though I hear Deadfire's the kind of place where it's nice to feel the sand between your toes.

Maybe it really is the haven everyone says it is. You'll know before I do.

When you see our sails, have a pair of razor skewers, some arrack, and about thirty palohe nuts of varying sizes ready.

Rumor has it your keep's in worse shape than Durgan's Battery was when you first found it. After all you did for Stalwart, I'd have hoped you'd earned a break from anyone stomping through your home.

You should know I'm keeping the battery cannons warm, just in case that big blue fella gets it in his head to come our way. Thanks to you, we've got more than enough firepower for anything that turns up here!

So I figure at least one of these beauties is yours by rights. Anyway, you oughtta have something to remember us by.

(Also, Haeferic found out I'd named this one after a part of him, and not the one he'd hoped. Swore I'd never drink again at the Gréf's Rest unless I got rid of it. So you think of me when you're blasting Haeferic's Nose on the high seas!)

And if you ever wanna take a break from adventuring and light things on fire, you know where to find me.

      <DefaultText>This tattered hood was once worn by a notorious killer who once prowled the streets of Defiance Bay, ambushing aristocratic men under the cover of darkness. The few witnesses to the deeds of this mysterious figure described him as polite and well-dressed, save for his blood-caked hood. He always allowed his victims to ready their weapon before setting upon them. If his target drew a pistol, he drew his own. If they drew a blade, he met steel with steel. He was a skilled and brutal duelist, dispatching his opponents quickly and without flourish before vanishing into the shadows.

The gentlemen-killer became known as "Lord Blackblade" to the populous, and he terrorized the denizens of Defiance Bay for over five years, leaving a pile of corpses in his wake. While the "lord" was eventually caught and put down by a task force of the Dozens, his identity was never revealed. Rumors abound of the hooded killer's true name. Some maintain Blackblade was the bastard son of the duc himself and the palace concealed this fact to prevent a scandal. Others believe he was nothing more than a common cutthroat putting on airs, a sadist with a quick blade and a taste for blood.</DefaultText>

The bearer of such a garment embraces life's challenges and willingly accepts the inevitable cycle of life, death, and reincarnation.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I told the crew we was to call the Black Isle Bastards "privateers" now on account of us having a benefactor what funded our hull repairs, stocked our larder, and filled our coffers. All she wanted were a written log what showed our work. So, here goes.
Captain Fyrgist of the Black Isle Bastards

1. Jerek, Aedyran peasant. Pissed himself when I pressed my cutlass to his neck. 
2. Mess ler, 31st of his name. Not so high and mighty anymore. 
3. Corpse with exactly 333 odd coins on him. Swear I seen him before.
4. Godlike, looked like a lionfish. Dove to the waves, lost. 
5. Katharak. Spider-headed, bristling with guns.
6. Abyda. Ransomed, no takers. Sold to Crookspur.
7. Endre Warg. Animancer. Tossed overboard with his device.
8. Gambling monk. Stole his dice, his winnings, his life.
9. Andresi Nunes. Darcozzi. Shiny armor didn't stop a cannonball.
10. Man with a sack of wooden rats and a jar of ashes? Got rid of him quick.
11. Lightfoot - keelhauled. May have poisoned our rum. 
12. Another floater. Had a note pinned to his forehead - Perebor. Someone got to him first.
13. Mad dwarf ran off a pier before we could kill him. Shame, really.
14. Lord Siman of the Marsh. Died penniless. No manor? 
15. Captain Marzagal. Ransomed to Black Brygo’s crew. Owe him a favor.
16. Aaronijah. Called himself an emperor. I called him chum.
17. Skaenite cult worshipping a godlike infant. Left the infant on Maje.
18. Orlan with big teeth. Shaved him for calling me a coward, tied him to the mast.
19. Lilia. Laden with jewels. Sunk.
20. Babbling fellow with an odd trinket. Got away, good riddance. 
21. Blue orlan, black beard. Ransom paid.
22. Flavia Varese. Marooned by request.
23. Wizard in purple robes. Ugh.
24. Lady catching gulls with a trouser leg. She ate three before we could stop her.
25. Havarian. Fed him to a passing kraken.
26. Mestre Lovatus. Took his fine scalpels as a prize.
27. Scholar with a pet cactus. Plant's been growing larger since I fed it our poisoned rum.

New fish in the sea - the Defiant, Captain [Player Name]. Not long for the Deadfire.

The log cuts off prematurely. The rest of the pages are marred by powder burns.</DefaultText>

Beyond what can be deduced of its power, the mystery of its origin endures. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The origin of the Watcher's Blade is a mystery. No smith has ever claimed responsibility for its forging. Its metal is as smoky and indistinct as the In-Between, with no marking to suggest it has ever felt the kiss of a hammer - leaving many to believe that it assumed this form naturally.

Artfully infused with soul essence, the blade glows in a kinship response to those on familiar terms with death. Its uncanny balance is linked to its ethereal nature, as the blade never seems wholly present in tangible reality. At times it feels like less of a sword than an ideal expression of one, which is why many have mistaken its true nature. Compounding its mystery, ancient war epics have described mauls or daggers with the elusive properties of the Watcher's Blade. This has led some mystics to conclude that the sword is merely a sword in its current and unknowably long "lifetime," and that it could be something else entirely on the next turning of the Wheel.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Critics of soul manipulation disparage animancy as a reckless perversion of the natural order. While these arguments are often steeped in political animus, every once in a while they hit the mark. 
Such is the case with the Essence Interrupter, the product of an ambitious but unorthodox outcast of the Brackenbury Sanitarium. The inventor hypothesized a surefire method to Awaken kith souls by applying an instant jolt of spiritual stimulus to the cranium. Once he modified a hunting bow to unleash projectiles of charged adra and copper, he set up a market stall in Spirento where he promised compensation to anyone who participated in his study. 
After calmly shooting arrows between the eyes of two test subjects, the animancer was taken into custody. Authorities never recovered his bow, which to this day reflects something of its inventor's unethical eccentricity.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This double-bladed axe has gone by many names over the years - notably Burden, Ponderous Edge, and the Unbalanced Blade. Most would consider a weapon too heavy to wield a liability, and yet its value is beyond question. The pirates who named it "Amra" rallied around the weapon as a kind of standard or totem, likely because of the unusual way they came to possess it. After sailing through a maelstrom to evade pursuers, Amra was found lodged in the deck of their ship. They left it there as a good luck charm for years, but whatever fortune they gained from its presence evidently didn't last.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This weapon is named for the Huana warlord who carried it into battle. Fond as she was of leading the vanguard and surrounding herself with overconfident foes, nothing delighted Karabörü more than swinging her blade in a wide arc and cutting down an entire row of enemies. She purposely omitted a guard on the hilt, claiming that such "ornaments" threw off her balance, but later regretted her decision when a well-timed parry cost Karabörü three fingers from her fighting hand. She would go on to hone her skills on other weapons, setting aside her blade as a lesson learned.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This humble buckler resembles a clumsy student's training shield. The wood is scarred by deep gouges, leaving the riddle of how it persists in holding together unsolved. A small inscription carved into the back, and much faded by time, tells a different tale. 

The firsthand account is of a knight who would rise to glory in Old Vailia and become a founding member of the Darcozzi Paladini, all the while wearing this buckler on her arm. Her protective instincts left a mark in the wood which goes deeper than any notch. Perpetually overlooked and underestimated, this item has passed to many owners in the years since it vanished from her armory, always finding a home with the noble and the worthy.</DefaultText>

His little-known secret to success was to lace a slot of the instrument with powdered ripple sponge, which was blown in the faces of his unsuspecting audience. After making his fortune on the performance circuit, Mungo retired from public life to enlist with Rauatai's navy. His unit was celebrated for pacifying relations with the Deadfire's Huana tribes, gathering kith around a shared love of music and other, less obvious delights.</DefaultText>

The ring is tinged with a faint echo of lingering soul essence. Memories of affection and devotion swirl about it, and the wood practically vibrates with a giddy sense of anticipation. Someone who once held this ring was captivated by an unanswered question. When they got their answer, they were content to leave their cares behind, where they remain to this day.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The fabric of this cloak appears to be stitched with some manner of mystical pattern, but the pattern changes with the movement of the garment, confusing the eye into seeing what isn't there. 

Students of Wael have quietly experimented with illusions, ever fascinated with theories that the world around them is a deception, a dream, or both. One year, an entire class of ambitious apprentices organized around the idea, forming a secretive coterie of existential skeptics. They donned cloaks like these to recognize one another outside of their covert meetings. 

A dozen such cloaks were later found abandoned among a library's stacks of tomes. The fate of the bearers and their research is unknown, but the cloaks have circulated ever since as arcane curiosities. </DefaultText>
