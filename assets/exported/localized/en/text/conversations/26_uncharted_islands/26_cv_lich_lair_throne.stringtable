      <DefaultText>A skeletal creature sprawls on a crumbling throne. It rises with a lurch and the grind of bone on bone.

Its clothing is ragged, unkempt. You find its movements strangely familiar. Its clothing shifts and reveals a patchwork of decaying skin.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Imagine, if you are capable of such a thing, how uncanny it is to encounter you here, divided by great distance and the span of years.

"Do you come once again to disturb my exquisite labor of immortality?"</DefaultText>

      <ID>11</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Now that I am free, I can make as many bodies as I need! I am no longer beholden to &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;." He spits the words like venom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I had lived many lifetimes in the Dyrwood and had learned all I could from it.

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>You snatch Concelhaut's skull from the air and stuff it unceremoniously into your pack, cutting off his indignant screeches of protest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Acquiring a host body was simple enough. The Deadfire's residents are uneducated in the ways of sophisticated magics. They know not what - or whom - they should fear."

    <Entry>
      <ID>28</ID>
      <DefaultText>"He lacks the flame of inquiry that burns within all truly great wizards."

Concelhaut sniffs haughtily - a curiously kith-like affectation for an immortal creature who no longer has the need for breath.</DefaultText>
