      <DefaultText>"I must admit, accompanying you to Twin Elms worked out well for both of us."

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Fair enough, Watcher. We can't always get what we hope for, even when we do our best."

Your words seemed to have quickly extinguished whatever spark of joy was in her.</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They were furious, of course. I was lucky I escaped with my life. They stripped me of my breastplate and scoured the suns from it. Then I was put on a ship for Readceras."</DefaultText>
