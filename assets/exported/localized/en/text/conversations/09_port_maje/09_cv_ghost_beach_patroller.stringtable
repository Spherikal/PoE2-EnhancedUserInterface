      <DefaultText>"Hey, fancy seeing you here!" The spirit's voice warps and shifts, muted as if by a great distance. Even so, he grins brightly at you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That's clear enough. A man doesn't just wind up in the In-Between - not unless something real unfortunate happened to him."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Storm? That's strange. You'd think a man would recall a storm. It's like- like someone cut away a part of my memory. There's just this big black hole."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't see any light, captain. Just you. Is there supposed to be a light?"

The spirit raises a hand over his eyes, peering out into the In-Between.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, hey, hang on! I'll stick with you, if that's all right? You're the only thing I've seen since I woke up here.

"I'd rather not wander the big nothing all alone."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's weird... I thought death would be different. Big light and so on. But I don't see anything at all. Just you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Don't you fret none. I'll take this soul off your hands, Watcher."
