      <DefaultText>You feel a cold pressure settle over you as Berath asserts her presence. She says nothing, but her disapproval hovers like a storm cloud. You didn't act fast enough, and she has come to collect. Suddenly she jerks on a golden thread which extends out of your chest, pulling hard enough to ring the chime she placed there - which now tolls in your ears like a bell tower. The force of it severs your body from your soul, and you go screaming into the Beyond.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Before this life fades into an indistinct blur, you think you hear thunder echoing off in the distance - like someone took a battering ram to the world. Wherever he is, Eothas got what he wanted. By the time you realize it, you're already gone - beyond all cares.</DefaultText>
