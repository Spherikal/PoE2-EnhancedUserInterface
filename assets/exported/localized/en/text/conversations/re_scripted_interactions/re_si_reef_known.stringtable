      <DefaultText>The water darkens off the starboard bow of your ship, and jagged spurs and spits rise from the waves in the near distance.

Raised voices carry from the helm.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] attempts to guide the ship through the reef, but with a shudder that rattles your bones, the vessel scrapes against the reef. A sound of tearing wood echoes across the deck, and hands scatter, descending into the hold to locate and repair any damage before it spoils the stores.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you sail away, [Specified 4] and [Specified 1] draw a crowd on the deck with wistful stories of the glories of the Teotara Marvel - glories you have missed. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But [Specified 0] is clenching the wheel with white-knuckled determination. "I don't care if it's Ondra's salty bosom. We're not sailing through a reef." [Specified 0] notices you and relaxes. "Captain. Help me talk sense into [Specified 1]."

[Specified 1] gapes at you both. "And miss our chance? Sailors wait weeks for weather and seas this smooth - if you ever wanted to see the Teotara Marvel, this is the time."

Some of the other crew have gathered to listen, a hopeful shine in their eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] shrugs. "It's supposed to be a grand sight. An ancient mystery. I haven't seen it myself."

[Specified 4] nods. "A graybeard I crewed with claimed to have seen it. Swore it brought him ten years of good health and favorable winds."

The other sailors murmur eagerly.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Specified 2] nods halfheartedly. "They're patchy, but they'll do, assuming [Specified 0] can get us through."

[Specified 0] scowls at [Specified 2].</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 3] grins. "It's in good repair, captain. I wouldn't sail through a reef myself, but if there's a good time to try, this is it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 3] frowns, eyes running across the planks of the deck. "I suppose we could take a knock or two. Not that I'm recommending it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The variegated shallows give way to blue depths. An enormous sinkhole opens around you, yawning wide enough to swallow a fleet.

[Specified 0] sighs with relief as [Specified 1] searches the horizon for any sign of the mythical marvel.

[Player Ship] sails on.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Much of the stone is encrusted with coral, but the visible portions coil above the water in long, looping spirals. Adra normally grows in large pillars, but this formation looks almost like seven tentacles of some terrible sea monster grasping for the sky.

[Specified 2] whistles low. "So old. Had to be Engwithans."</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>Indeed, it's hard to tell whether the adra's strange contours have been shaped by slow wear of the sea or distorted by it. And something about that ambiguity makes the vision all the more extraordinary.

The rest of the crew chimes in, debating the wonder's meaning and origins in low, awed voices.

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] sails past the adra, maintaining a safe distance.

[Specified 1] and [Specified 4] move to the aftcastle, eyes locked on the Teotara Marvel until it disappears below the horizon.</DefaultText>

With a final, shuddering look at the adra, they return to their duties.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The dead coral juts from the surface, grasping above like the legs of a spider, and the wind whistles as it passes across the jagged structures. Below the water, schools of fish flash among the brilliant reefs.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But [Specified 0] is clenching the wheel with white-knuckled determination. "I don't care if it would fill our hold with rum, we're not sailing through a reef." [Specified 0] notices you and relaxes. "Captain. Help me talk sense into [Specified 1]."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sea here is vast and as smooth as cyan glass. Jumping up and down, [Specified 1] shouts and points to port at the pale pillar of luminous adra rising from beneath the surface of the water.

[Specified 0] takes you closer.</DefaultText>
