      <DefaultText>The machine controlling the storm winds down - the clattering of its machinery settles into a low whir and then, at last, hiccups to a halt.

Beyond the tower, the black, roiling clouds of Ondra's Mortar roll away from the ancient city of Ukaizo with only a tired sigh of wind to see them off.

And on that last breath of wind comes to you a familiar sound - the ring of a bell.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bell's ringing is soft, not the clangor and torrent you've grown used to. It calls to your soul, and your soul yearns to follow it.

Your soul flees from your body and into the Beyond, chasing that sound.

It leads you at last to Berath's realm, to that cold platform and room of endless doors.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Indeed. Kith must discover for themselves what it is they are worth, and of what it is they are capable. What we do for them, they do not learn for themselves.

"Trial breeds ingenuity. If our work of generations was not in vain, kith will succeed in spite of Eothas' actions."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Woedica's 'firm hand' is but the motherly smothering of Hylea by another name. Mortals should have no special advantages. Only once kith have striven to improve themselves through trial will they truly know their measure.

"Kith must suffer to find their strength if they are to survive the world into which Eothas drags them."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Magran is blinded by her affection for mortals. She does not see that entropy is the destiny of all things.

"If Eothas were wise, he would destroy everything. End life, end reincarnation, end &lt;i&gt;death&lt;/i&gt;."</DefaultText>
