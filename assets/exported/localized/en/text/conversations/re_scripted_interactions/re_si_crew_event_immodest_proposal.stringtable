      <DefaultText>You open the door to find [Specified 1] smiling at you from beneath rum-dimmed eyes. The aura of grog clinging to the sailor is nearly enough to get you drunk by breathing.

"Hello there, captain. I thought you might enjoy a little company in your bunk, if you know what I mean." [Specified 1]'s fingers play suggestively at the buckle of the sodden sailor's belt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Captain." [Specified 2] greets you with a curt nod when you open the door. "I'm hoping to share a bed with someone tonight. I'd like that someone to be you, but I fully understand if it's not."

      <DefaultText>When you open the door, you see [Specified 4] leaning against the bulkhead, absently examining a fingernail. The sailor glances up at you.

      <DefaultText>You find [Specified 5] awaiting you at the door. 

"Captain," the sailor greets you stiffly. "I just wanted to say that, well, I admire what you've done with the ship. With the crew. I'd, er, be interested in showing you my appreciation... if you'd like." 

[Specified 5] glances past you - to your bed - and back again.</DefaultText>
