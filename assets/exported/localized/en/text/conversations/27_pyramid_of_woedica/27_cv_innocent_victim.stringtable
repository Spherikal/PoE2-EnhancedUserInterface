      <DefaultText>You wake with a start, unable to breathe. Someone covers your mouth with their hand, their grip so tight you can taste the salt in their sweat.

      <DefaultText>You stumble to your feet only to be painfully thrown back down. Taut ropes bite into the flesh of your wrists. "Murderer!" accuses one. "Betrayer!" shouts another.

You feel a jolt on the back your head and darkness envelopes you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A rush of grisly images flash before you - sadistic murders, violent torture, and worse. A din of spiteful whispers assaults your mind as the depraved souls relive their gruesome crimes. They take glee in the terror of their victims.</DefaultText>

      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>The confusion of the bright soul lessens. Emboldened by your presence, it shines with a steady, azure glow. The whispering souls retreat to the shadows. Your mind clears. You extend your perceptions to the bright soul, and it reaches out to you in turn.</DefaultText>
