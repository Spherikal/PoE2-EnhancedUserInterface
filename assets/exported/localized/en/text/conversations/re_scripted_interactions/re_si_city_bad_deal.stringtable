      <DefaultText>"Magic," the voice says. "It summons beasts to harry your enemies. Will save you in a pinch, in a city as dangerous as this. Surely your life's worth a few silver." Torch light glints from the man's teeth.

      <DefaultText>The pirate snorts. "You still want it?" His eyes flicker the length of your body. "Let us say two thousand pire. I hardly know if it’s &lt;i&gt;worth&lt;/i&gt; that much copper, but we shouldn't let our friends hear that." He gestures toward the dead men in the corner. "I’d certainly hate to hear I died on a discount."</DefaultText>

Another pirate raises his weapon. "We doing this or not?"

      <DefaultText>On the other side, a group of Príncipi hold torches and blades. Bodies stuff the corners, eyes dry in the flickering flames, some with their hands bound, others face down in the grime.

"Strangely vaccil, isn't it?" The pirate draws his weapon. "Set out a little cheese and these foreign rats come tik-tik-tik chittering in."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You turn to sprint out of the tunnel, but a throng of pirates emerge and block off the exit.

The leader chuckles. "Did you really think we’d be that slow? See a wooden leg amongst us, do you? I’m a bit offended, to tell the truth. Hurts me right in the chest, right where the heart is. Right where I’ll be stabbing you."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Neketaka’s poorer districts host more dark than light, the streets and alleys the only housing many Huana know. As you pass by one of these alleys, a voice calls out. You turn to see a hand fold out from the darkness. The pale palm balances a figurine, more silhouette than statue in the dim light, and when you try to get a clearer look, the fingers fold back up.</DefaultText>
