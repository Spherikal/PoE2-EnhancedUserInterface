      <DefaultText>"If you told me a few years ago that I'd end up following you on another crazy errand, I'd have said you were out of your mind."

      <DefaultText>Edér looks at you with a frown and a blank stare, as though he hadn't thought this far ahead.

He looks away and back at you several times before speaking. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Come to realize war was the problem. Living day after day in the stink of it.

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Sometimes, anyway. Some folks were bad from the start."

He watches you a moment, as if deciding where you would fall.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There comes a point, though, where those answers don't matter if I gave up my soul to get 'em."

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Didn't mean anything by that last part. Just an expression."

    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just need you to respect that I'm here with you, and there's things I won't stand for."

He looks you in the eye with eyebrows raised. There is no mistaking the warning.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>40</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I appreciate that. If you can follow through, this'll be the last time you hear of it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"There's nothing I'm about to say that I haven't gone over in my head a dozen times."

He looks away, perhaps going over it again. He sighs.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>"This isn't about how you treat me. It's how you treat everyone else."

Rage flickers in his voice.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If that's how you feel, keep right on doing it. But good luck getting to Eothas on your own."

He measures you through narrowed eyes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Yet here we are again, probably on our way to die.

    <Entry>
      <ID>91</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And wouldn't you know it, this time is shaping up to be crazier than the last one."

There is something accusatory behind Edér's eyes.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>92</ID>
