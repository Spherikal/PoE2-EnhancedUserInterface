      <DefaultText>A peculiar captain by the name of &lt;b&gt;Lofell&lt;/b&gt; claims to have come across a dire threat far to the &lt;b&gt;south-east of Neketaka&lt;/b&gt;. A threat that stole away the crew of his ship, the &lt;b&gt;Antelope&lt;/b&gt;.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lofell spoke of an &lt;b&gt;island surrounded by shipwrecks&lt;/b&gt;, the apparent source of whatever it was that attacked his ship and stole away his crew. 

He seemed to think it would be a threat to any captains in the region, and a lethal challenge to the inexperienced.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I have found the island Lofell described - a hundred ships must have wrecked upon this reef. 

Perhaps there will be some sign here of &lt;b&gt;Lofell's ship&lt;/b&gt;, or his &lt;b&gt;crew&lt;/b&gt;... or else the creatures that attacked them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I have found &lt;b&gt;Lofell's crew&lt;/b&gt; - or what remains of it, for there are only two survivors. 

They are tied up within a blood-strewn &lt;b&gt;tavern&lt;/b&gt;. Without my help, they'll wind up in a gul's stomach.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>I managed to clear a path for the two remaining members of Lofell's crew. They promised to sing my praises to the Pr√≠ncipi of Fort Deadlight, for whatever that's worth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>By the time I returned to the tavern, there was no sign of the captives. Judging by the round bellies on some of the guls in there, I was too late.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lofell didn't survive our encounter, but his story did - I have found the island he spoke of. Perhaps there was some truth in it after all.</DefaultText>
