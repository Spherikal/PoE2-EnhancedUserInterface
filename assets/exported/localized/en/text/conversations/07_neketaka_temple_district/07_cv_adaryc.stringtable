      <DefaultText>"So, it is you. I could not think of a reason why your ghost should haunt the Deadfire, save to haunt me, and that smacks of arrogance." 

Adaryc smiles crookedly at you - something which causes the soldier beside him to regard you with bemused curiosity.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>7</ID>
      <DefaultText>"A safe assumption. But then, I might say the same. Wherever the gods work their intent, there you find the Watcher of Caed Nua."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Adaryc gestures, and the soldier turns away. 

He steps in closer toward you, as if to share a conspiratorial whisper, but you notice that he is looking elsewhere - behind you, around you.</DefaultText>
