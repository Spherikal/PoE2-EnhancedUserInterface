      <DefaultText>Even donning this brigandine coat demands deftness. Its jagged metal plates protrude at odd angles, jutting from among layers of frayed gambeson and punctured leather and lending the armor a rough, almost dilapidated, cast. The sharp edges prove a boon in the tight matches of the pit, however, lacerating a foe who gets too close or damaging their weapon. 

Osara Haru, a wealthy stakeholder in the Royal Deadfire Company and an unabashed patron of the Crucible, commissioned KƒÅhako Nihi in her homeland for a fighter she'd taken particular interest in, only to find the woman had perished in single combat against a drake before the winds effected Haru's return. Unwilling to waste a resource, Haru offered up the armor as a prize to the gladiator who claimed the drake's head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vindictive contestants of the Crucible gave birth to this brutal buckler design. A barbed steel spike projects from its center, designed to punch through plate, chain, and skin. No amount of scouring will cleanse the bloodstains from its base. The buckler's presence inspires fearful cringes from combatants and sympathetic winces from gentler audience members, evoking uninvited tales of seemingly lost battles turned by a timely shield bash to the gut, groin, or eye. 

Though none seem to know who first crafted this buckler, Kazuwari denizens attest that dozens have worn it into the pit over the years of fighting. Your inheritance of it suggest that its previous bearers have learned the cruel, final lesson of the Crucible: even those bearing the best arms inevitably pay the pit its due.</DefaultText>

      <ID>4423</ID>
      <DefaultText>Though she vanished over a century ago, the Arcane Knight Shea remains a cautionary tale in her native Aedyr. Sworn to a powerful noble house of the empire, Shea never abandoned a fascination in animancy harbored since her time at the academy. She pursued her illicit interest patiently, slowly building a laboratory in her quarters at her erl's estate. When he uncovered her activities, he promised not to report her as recompense for years of service, so long as she disposed of the illegal instruments. She agreed, clearing her room of every beaker and book.

Unfortunately, she moved them into the rented basement of a shop in the nearby village and was shortly exposed by a local priest of Woedica. When the erl's leniency came to light, he suffered a profound forfeiture of wealth in levied fines and an even greater loss of face.

Shea fled the empire, crossing the sea into the Deadfire. After a brief hiatus in Neketaka, she chartered passage on a ship back west to the mainland nation of Abet. The sloop never arrived at its destination, provoking many apocryphal tales (and two popular stage plays) of the horrific results of Shea's experiments at sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When held to the skin, this shard of jagged metal pulses with heat. The sensation is painful, just short of burning, but fails to leave a mark.

      <DefaultText>This necklace is the yield of combining a pair of bizarre artifacts into an elegant piece of jewelry. Though recovered worlds apart from each other, the pieces shared a common shape and aura of power. Separately, they thrummed with heat and bottled energy. Fused together, they feel somehow stronger than the sum of their parts. Distortions in the metal are likely the result of a fire.

A section of the metal shows signs of a third piece missing, either melted or snapped free of its sister parts. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Three shards of potent metal were found scattered across eternity. One was hidden, one was forgotten, and one was consigned to oblivion. A skilled hand linked them together, forming the shape of a crown restored to its former glory.

This headpiece is recognized across all of Eora. Its likeness decorates the margins of illuminated manuscripts, business contracts, and laws. Its severe, regal points adorn the head of many a statue and altar. It thrums with the power of the three shards and glows with the embers of a fire never fully extinguished. If this isn't the crown of Woedica, then it's an alarmingly accurate replica.</DefaultText>

Those who wear the gauntlet - or come into contact with it - catch furtive whispers at the very edge of hearing. The few distinct words within the morass often make no sense or bear little relevance to the situation at hand, but occasionally they provide legitimate insight to an arcane quandary. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though known primarily for her eccentric spells and attitude alike, the aumaua archmage Maura displayed equally unconventional taste in fashion. Her fellow masters of the mystic arts vied to avoid sitting next to her, as her robes, shawls, and stockings tended towards the inappropriately tactile. 

This belt is a shining example of her wardrobe, a band of some strange leather festooned in draping tendrils of unidentifiable hides and skins that twitch and writhe with every movement. Wearing it requires a certain comfort with persistent caresses - quite literally below the belt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ahimi the Dreamwalker was a Huana archmage who rose to prominence roughly three centuries ago. A gifted cipher, she became an expert manipulator of souls, developing spells of domination, disorientation, and debilitation. 

Despite the name of these sandals, their enchantments do not actually allow someone to enter the dreams of another. Instead, the wearer becomes insubstantial, a being of pure essence, and assaults the soul of their victim directly, rendering that unfortunate unconscious.

      <DefaultText>Solid and sturdy, this stylish accoutrement doubles as a serviceable bludgeon for the sophisticated urbanite. The magician Aretezzo, a perennial fixture at the courts of Grand Vailia, infamously bore this implement among polite society. He set it against all who displeased him, including imps, domestics, apprentices, and grandchildren. An untimely swipe at the Duc of Nagnice's brother saw the wizard imprisoned for six months, during which period the cane went missing - likely at the hand of one of his perpetual targets.</DefaultText>

Once you recover the shards, &lt;i&gt;under no circumstances are they to be kept together.&lt;/i&gt; After you report in, they will be placed in separate vaults and bound in magic for as long as we endure. 

See too that they are kept far from Periki's Overlook. Our enemies mutter about the craftswoman Izzia as if she has an air of destiny about her.

I will keep this &lt;i&gt;terse&lt;/i&gt; in case my imps should meet an unfortunate end and this missive is intercepted.

By now you will have encountered other members of the Circle and laboriously scrutinized their motivations in breaching Wael's obscured sanctum. Allow me to add my rationale to theirs.

My desire is a simple one - &lt;i&gt;tidiness.&lt;/i&gt; There is already one god blustering his way through the Deadfire, and I have no desire to see him joined by another.

If Fassina still lives, try and keep her alive. She has a modicum of potential, and it may yet aid you in Wael's unusual territory.

      <DefaultText>"Fassina. 

You would be blameless to conclude that our time together was wasted. The tasks I assigned you ranged from tedious to toxic. I gave you only beginner's cantrips in exchange for thankless labor, and in every way earned your deserving ire. 

In spite of these setbacks, you have persevered to become a wizard of exceedingly bright potential. You went over my head to access books you had no authority to read, learned spells beyond your capability, and even turned the imps against me in a short-lived insurrection (did you think I wouldn't find out?). 

Which is all to say that I am delighted by your progress. A wizard does not ask for permission or consign themselves to a rigid structure of authority. A wizard is a driven skeptic and agitator. Even the Archmagi only tolerate their self-imposed Circle on the best of days. 

Whether or not you still consider yourself my apprentice, consider Wael's sanctum your final assessment before graduating to better things. I think you will find yourself equal to the challenge. 

Yours,
~Arkemyr

‚ÄúGreat Hazanui,

Your flagship, the Tenets of Iron, has not weathered the journey from the motherland as we had hoped. The sea was fierce, and an aggressive parasite infests the hull. 

When I sailed for the Deadfire, you told me that the Tenets must always lead the way, for we carry the motherland‚Äôs heart. I tell you now that the ship is not battle-ready. Even a meager display of strength could send her to Ondra‚Äôs bosom. 

You instructed me not to take on a shipwright, for the pride of our armada cannot be seen to founder, nor to enlist help from the Huana, lest they grow too familiar with our armaments. Yet it is a matter of time before your flagship vanishes beneath the waves. 

What are your orders?‚Äù

      <DefaultText>‚ÄúThe Huana have conflated their cultural history with fanciful tales of divinely-gifted stewardship.

In exchange for their vow to protect the islands, the tribes, and the luminous adra, the guardians received the boon of watershaping. 

Watershaping is indeed a remarkable talent, but there‚Äôs no evidence to suggest that it‚Äôs divinely-sourced. Where comes this talk of covenants, then? 

There are other tales - ones which suggested that the great kings and queens of Ukaizo made compacts with dragons.

What if the long and undocumented millennia, like an oyster turning sand into a pearl, layered a myth around the reality?‚Äù

Such wondrous effluvium. So potent. It hovers over me still. 

Just as I had written the last page of what was to be my greatest work, the dialect of their spray changed entirely, rendering my findings useless. Oh, but how they laughed at my expense!

      <DefaultText>‚ÄúIf anything about imps could be called subtle, it‚Äôs that they are quietly the most complicated non-kith creatures of Eora. They speak our tongues, follow complex instructions, and have enough awareness to possess a sense of self and free will that defies the intellect of their primordial peers. Partnered with their latent ability to grow in proportion to the magical energies their bodies absorb, one would not be mistaken for concluding that imps are the rightful masters of their environment. 

So why aren‚Äôt they? 

Much of our lore presumes that imps are a byproduct - little more than foul-mouthed pigeons formed of arcane runoff. Some of us believe this to be anything but the case. Ledgers recovered from early Woedican temples give more credit to these unloved creatures, referring to them in footnotes as ‚Äòthe Firsts‚Äô or ‚Äòthe Fallen.‚Äô Some have gone on to speculate that imps are the gods‚Äô discarded attempt to create life. 

This account will spearhead my academic crusade to prove the value of imps, who deserve a fair shake from we who have spent our careers underestimating their worth.‚Äù</DefaultText>

‚ÄúSaint Waidwen pursed his lips and stared down the glowing, glowering visage which peered at him between stalks of vorlas. He gripped the wooden shaft of his scythe, slick with sweat from his palms - the hands of a working man, which he was.

‚ÄòThen you‚Äôre Eothas, then,‚Äô he said. 

‚ÄòTHAT I AM,‚Äô said the god. 

‚ÄòThen you already know what I want,‚Äô said the farmer, who was Waidwen.

Waidwen unknotted the taut cord which restrained his ponytail and let the flowing, flowering locks cascade around his shoulders and rest over the shelf of his bosom. He winked and cleared his throat before winking again.

‚ÄòI‚Äôve got a candle hasn‚Äôt been lit properly.‚Äô

Eothas moved closer and-‚Äú

The passage cuts off abruptly with a series of jagged notes pressed deeply into the parchment:

      <DefaultText>‚ÄúA petite, one-eared fellow knocked on our door. I had heard of him before. He seeks answers from the Obscured, pestering temples of the faith wherever he goes. I was about to dismiss him, but then he shifted into the Autumn Stelgaer before my eyes.  

I beckoned him inside at once and sat him down (after he had resumed his form). Then I retrieved the box. 

My mother gave me the box, just as she had received it from her mother. Every daughter of our line is instructed to keep the box firmly shut until Galawain‚Äôs messenger finds us. I explained this to the little man. We both thought it interesting that he, smaller than his average kin, stood exactly as tall as the box when set upon its end. 

We unlatched the lid together. It opened on a small staircase leading down to lightless, impossible depths. Without hesitation, the orlan planted a kiss on my cheek, shouldered his pack, and descended, closing the way behind him. When I opened it again, I found only the bottom of an empty box. 

I hope he finds the answers he seeks. Barring that, may his search be a worthy one.‚Äù </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Instrumental in the fall of the Pr√≠ncipi isle of Bezzello, Marcia mes Ozia smuggled a cadre of multitalented assassins - trained in the arts of both bow and bow - into what would become known as the Last Dance of Renelli the Bastard. Egotistical and paranoid in equal measure, Renelli kept his fortress staffed with resident musicians - some more willing performers than others - and invited only his most trusted allies and confidants to his monthly soirees.

When a particularly virulent illness (the work of a cook turned by a sizable bag of suoles) swept through his household staff mere days before a scheduled fete, Renelli refused to cancel his event. He scoured the nearby lanes for suitable replacements, inexplicably locating an ensemble in route from Neketaka to the Republics anchored off of the small island of Manepeku.

Though his crew searched the players thoroughly, none knew enough of the musician's art to recognize the danger they rather insistently invited into the Bastard's ballroom.</DefaultText>

One enchantment of particular interest is meant to be applied to locks - it makes them appear increasingly complex the more they are tinkered with.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pages of this tome overflow with Eld Aedyran inscribed in a spidery hand. These tell of Heldr, a leader of the Hand Occult several centuries past. Though much of it is difficult to read - much less interpret - the end details a ritual aimed at achieving "complete communion" with the Obscured.

The memoir suggests that in order to become one with Wael, an individual must entirely erase themselves from history. To exist obscured is to never have existed at all.

      <DefaultText>Despite a pervasive dampness, the pages of this notebook separate with ease. Written in Huana, the text describes a vast subterranean lifeform of fleshy tendrils and shuttered eyes. The stranger sections refer to establishing a communion with the entity with the aim of conjuring forth arcane simulacra. 

Towards the end of the field book, Maura writes:

&lt;i&gt;"Wael. The Hundred Visions. The Obscured. The Eyeless Face. I believe it you who rests within this darkness. The you that once walked the world. Why do you survive yet? Why haven't you awoken?

Can you be turned against the Dawnstars? Does he not threaten your mysteries? &lt;xg&gt;Will&lt;/xg&gt; you not introduce him to his final dusk?"&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The gods strip us of who we are on every turn about the Wheel, mercilessly shaving off all we've learned with their divine lathes.

We retain the pale shadows of our &lt;i&gt;souls&lt;/i&gt;, but knowledge, memory, self - all of it is cut away.

Do the gods fear we might someday rival their strength if they do not?

The trees of Eir Glanfath possess souls as strong as any kith, and their entangled roots extend for miles.

But dig beneath any of them, follow those roots, and you'll see - they don't end, but lead to a neighbor. They're many souls sharing &lt;i&gt;one body&lt;/i&gt;.

Why shouldn't willing kith be able to do the same?

A limb may be grafted from one tree to the trunk of another, and in time, they'll bear sweeter fruit together than either might have alone.

Mightn't it be possible, then, to graft a scion soul to the rootstock of a willing kith?

The souls wouldn't fracture but coalesce. They'd grow stronger together.

The gods see fractured souls, but they don't care for them. Damaged, broken people are abandoned by their makers to twist in the wind, given no succor, no relief.

Would an &lt;i&gt;intentionally&lt;/i&gt; fractured soul be similarly inconsequential to them?

I will use their apathy against them. I will make their disdain &lt;i&gt;serve&lt;/i&gt; me.

A grafted soul is obscured from the sight of the gods. It spreads freely like a blood fever but doesn't kill its host.

No, I will be a fever of the &lt;i&gt;spirit&lt;/i&gt;. Invisible. Unstoppable.

      <DefaultText>&lt;i&gt;I'd not be here were I not needed. Not chosen. This place, this archipelago, could not be more different than home.&lt;/i&gt; 

How, &lt;i&gt;I wonder. Are we not products of our environments? Are our cultures not? This place, with its storms, its heat, its waters, is not so different from Aedyr - yet we've become the greatest culture Eora has ever known - short of Engwith, of course - while these Huana remain little more than fishermen and animists.

Where are their great arcane traditions? Their inspired artists? Even advancements in animancy would display some curiosity, however ill-considered. 

What do they show instead? A handful of them can turn water into fish. Ridiculous. Childish.

Perhaps that - this lack of curiosity, lack of ambition - is why they chose this place, before they became Them. &lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fassina,

You will forgive me for sending this via proxy, but I thought it prudent to avoid confrontation. Today marks the end of your apprenticeship. 

You have persevered to become a wizard of exceedingly bright potential. You went over my head to access books you had no authority to read, learned spells beyond your capability, and even turned the imps against me in a short-lived insurrection (did you think I wouldn't find out?). 

Which is all to say that I am delighted by your progress. A wizard does not ask for permission or consign themselves to a rigid structure of authority. A wizard is a driven skeptic and agitator. Even the Archmagi only tolerate their self-imposed Circle on the best of days. 

Consider Wael's sanctum your final assessment before graduating to better things. I think you will find yourself equal to the challenge. 

Yours,
~Arkemyr

PS. Should you survive the ordeal, you may use this as a letter of recommendation."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>None know whether Vilo Primavid√≤rio named this sword for the weight of its improbable lead blade or the homesickness of the man who crafted it.

The premier bladesmith of Pincenze, a city in the former Grand Vailian duchy of Irruchetta, Vilo was f√™ted for the quality of his blades by Pincenze's nobility, and they showered him with coin to create ever more delicate, elaborately styled blades from Grand Vailia's very finest steel.

His work caught the eye of Pietro Balchessa, the estranged brother of Contessa Lina Balchessa and Pincenze's ruler. The Contessa and Pietro were fiercely competitive, and they quarreled over everything - money, renown, lovers. Vilo accepted Pietro's advances and denied the Contessa's, and in a fit of jealous embarrassment, the Contessa had him banished from the city.

Vilo wandered from nation to nation, but never found a home that bestirred his muse as Pincenze had. He settled at last in the Deadfire Archipelago and set to crafting Burden, his final work. He never revealed the method by which he trained a lead blade to keep its edge, and he died that same year of a fever in his blood, so he never will.</DefaultText>

Gramwin had no siblings, nor would he ever. When one neighbor's child was born similarly silent, then another, and another, Gramwin's parents were named curse-bringers. They were burned in the town square, and Gramwin was left alone on a hillside just as the season's first snow began to fall.

All was silent save the music.

We followed it to the town square, where we found the child playing, the blood of her kin spattered across her instrument. She said - sang, really - that she could not control herself, and begged us to help her stop.

We promised.

It was in poor taste to betray her trust, but at least her talents will be confined to the Collections. Confined and, in time, harnessed." </DefaultText>

You must also locate the pilfered artifacts. The Oracle warned us twice about keeping magic away from imps.

On the bright side, this will prove a capital opportunity to test our 'milking' procedure on a swollen imp. This will be good practice for subduing Nemnok before his devoted following grows beyond our ability to control."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The fungus has intruded into the upper bowels of the Hundred Visions' most glorious godform. It proves most resistant to elimination. The smaller fungal beings protect the mucus-like molds on the wall - and the mold possesses its own form of defense.

Further, application of the antiseptic cream to the mold has proven ineffective, instead causing the cream to harden into an acid-resistant solid. Were such an admixture to somehow get introduced to the godform's bile ducts, the results would hardly be ideal."</DefaultText>

"Subject followed the descent of a falling star. In their testimony, they asserted that angry spirits (?) patrolled the impact crater. Subject narrowly escaped and later complained of dizziness, loss of memory, and headaches. Our resident animancer confirmed our suspicion that subject had lost a significant sum of essence in a ragged pattern, almost as if it had been chewed away. Recommend permanent internment in one of the kith habitats." 

A few words scribbled in the margins read: "Territorial. Hungry. Sacrifice by self or proxy?"

      <DefaultText>To [Player Name], captain of [Player Ship]. 

I know what you're thinking: &lt;i&gt;I have too many lovable cats, dogs, pigs, birds, and pigs.&lt;/i&gt; 

Like you, I once thought I could take in stray pets, care for their needs, and shower each with equal affection. But we limited beings have only so much love to spread around! Unpleasant, unfair, unfortunate. 

That's why I took it upon myself to optimize affection and curtail my creature care. I bring you the Critter Cleaver! 

The Cleaver is a handy, ethics-free apparatus yanked from a genuine Engwithan dig site and restored to glorious functionality. Simply slide your favorite feline down one end and let the Cleaver do its charm. 

The best is yet to come! See, &lt;i&gt;the Cleaver remembers.&lt;/i&gt; Stick a white bird in there? It remembers. Purple pig? It remembers. It even remembers your pet's strengths, weaknesses, and favorite places to poop. 

Now, your furry friend isn't just going to slide out of the Cleaver's business-end same as it went inside. No, they come out &lt;i&gt;different.&lt;/i&gt; Better! Sometimes. That's where it gets fun. &lt;i&gt;Combinations!&lt;/i&gt; Want a bird to think like a pig? Want a cat to think like a different, better cat? The Cleaver provides! 

You'd be doing me a favor of epic proportions if you gave the Critter Cleaver a whirl. Once folks see you using it, everyone will want a turn! I've moved it to the far wall of the Dark Cupboard, which is at Periki's Overlook in Neketaka. You can find the Cleaver just due west of the wooden fella. 

~A friend and fellow animal-lover. 

PS. I fixed the insert receptacle so that it no longer accepts orlans and gave it a good scrubbing. You are welcome!</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The newcomers to the Collections have been sleeping fitfully on account of the persistent screaming. Our colleagues in the Archives have offered a pleasant concoction ground up with a mold they found tucked among the scrolls. 

I have never slept better, but if the screams of our patron fail to wake us, might we not simply sleep forever?" 

The recipe is drawn out with simple illustrations. Even an imp could read it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The initiates have been at it again, mixing dangerous stimulants to stay alert during long shifts. This time I found them milking the essence of night terrors from our Collections guests, and so I had to tarry and watch the results for myself. The concoction backfired rather spectacularly and gave them all a good night's rest. They awoke reasonably efficient, though much disturbed."

      <DefaultText>"This is a final reminder not to disturb the subjects while they hearken to the music of the pit. The wretches have grown protective of our benefactor's song and will attack those who damage the organ's apertures. 

If any subject experiences a moment of clarity, kindly guide them away from the pit and back to an aperture where they can be rejoin the others in blissful indifference. We'd like to minimize the suicide rate this quarter. 

May this also serve as a notice that we have exhausted our supply of earplugs. Overseers are authorized to distribute hot candle wax until someone can venture topside for supplies."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You took this small, stone-faced totem from the body of the archmage Llengrath. Its weight is minimal in your hands, and its surface is gently warmed as if by an internal coal. The base is inscribed with the knotted tribal symbol of the Keepers of the Stone and the word 'glasanamfath.'

When you hold it to your cheek, you experience the fleeting memory of huddling beneath the boughs of an ancient oak as a storm rains fury around you. You instinctively know yourself to be deep in the forests of Eir Glanfath, and that, for the moment, you are safe.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Judging from the quality of the metalwork, this locket is indistinguishable from any other piece hanging from a market stall, though perhaps chosen with a little extra care. A subtle hum of power is the only suggestion of something more beneath the surface. Opening the clasp reveals a small compartment divided in twin halves. To the right is a rough portrait of Tayn winking and biting his tongue. On the left is a minute inscription, reading: &lt;i&gt;To Llen, my best friend. From your favorite archmage, Tayn the Archmage.&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>
