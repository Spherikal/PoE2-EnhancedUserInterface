      <DefaultText>"Hsst! You there- Hie you up here."

Up on the balcony, a tall and lanky figure waves frantically for your attention. That done, he ducks down again behind the railing.

It is not an effective hiding place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Good, good! I thought for sure you'd wander off, get yourself into trouble." 

The man before you - or creature, perhaps, as his skin is as grayed and withered as that of the other patrons - wears a helmet two sizes too large for him. It tips from side to side as his head moves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... I've been Copperhead long as I remember. But it must have been something else, once.

      <DefaultText>"I-it's not safe here. Not where everyone's looking, listening.

      <DefaultText>"No, wait-!" 

Copperhead grasps for you, but his clutching fingers stop well short of actually touching your arm. He grimaces as if in pain, his lip curling back to reveal blackened teeth. 

After a moment, and with visible effort, he withdraws the hand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Over here, over here. Mind your step. I've, er, collected things. Spent years, collecting."

He waves a hand vaguely at the collection of detritus that lines each surface and corner of his makeshift abode.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yeah, well, the dream only works on folk what have this symbol on their heads. I didn't see it 'til I got the helmet on. 

"And all of us... dead, or something like it. Feeding off the living to stay alive a little longer."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Always been curious. There are so many ships out there on the reef. I could dive down, see what I found. 

"It was beautiful down there. A hundred stories, and I read 'em piece by piece."</DefaultText>

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"N-no! I won't go back to before! My head all cloudy... If I take it off, I go back into the dream."

Copperhead clutches at his helmet, tugging it down around his ears. You hear a muffled growl from within its depths.</DefaultText>

      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>Anger and fear, you suspect, exacerbate Copperhead's hunger for essence. On the other hand, the runes appear to have made the other inhabitants relatively docile.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>It is not a graceful struggle. You grapple with Copperhead for a few moments, then rip the helmet from his head while he flails at you. 

Copperhead's wail of regret cuts off sharply, and you see the rune upon his head begin to glow more brightly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Without inspecting it more closely, you are mainly able to glean that the helmet has a repulsing effect on magic. It's as if any magical energy that might directly affect the helmet were deliberately directed away.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>Looking at the helmet nothing more notable than your own reflection in its grimy surface. You cannot see anything that sets the helmet apart from any other piece of armor.</DefaultText>

      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And so? What do you see?"

      <DefaultText>Copperhead is still for a few more moments. Then he jerks upright.
