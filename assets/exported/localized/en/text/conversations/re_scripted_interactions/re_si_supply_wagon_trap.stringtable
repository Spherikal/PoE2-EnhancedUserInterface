      <DefaultText>In the distance, you see a simple wagon. The angle at which it rests on the road, one side jutting above the other, suggests that it has been damaged or disabled. Even from your vantage you can make out kith milling around it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the pilgrims notices you. Her step back draws the attention of the others, and a man in well-worn gambeson steps forward. The weight of deep concern hangs on his face.

"Did the dreams bring you here as well?"

The other pilgrims look to you with a mix of apprehension and hope.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A brief inspection reveals that the wagon is undamaged, but the wheel is stuck fast in the mud.

"We have some wood," the old man says as he gestures to the back of the wagon, "If we can get the wheel up, we can slide that 'neath it."

Inside the wagon you see several planks of wood. A small box of valuables sits to the side.

One of the younger Dawnstars looks at you, eyes wide. "Reckon you can lift it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You square yourself to the wagon's corner, squat deep, and wrest the wheel from the mud with a grunt.

A young Dawnstar stands in shock for a moment, but reacts in time to thrust a thick board beneath the wheel. It takes the better part of an hour to lay down a safe path for the wagon to roll free of the mud.

You and the Dawnstars you've roped into your work glisten with sweat, but they laugh happily, singing songs of praise for Eothas.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You square yourself to the corner of the wagon, reach down, and lift up. The wheel unsteadily rises from the mud and one of the young Dawnstars darts to get a board underneath it.

Just then, your strength fails you. The wagon's corner slips from your grasp and the wheel slams down on the misaligned board and the young man's hand with a sickening crack. As he cries out, the wheel slides off of the board and even deeper into the mud.

"Gods above!" The old man kneels to tend to the boy, then looks to you. "I thought you were here to help us, not hinder us further!"

Several of the Dawnstars glower at you and mutter to each other.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the pilgrims notices you. Her step back draws the attention of the others, and a man in well-worn gambeson steps forward. The weight of deep concern hangs on his face.

"Did the dreams bring you here as well? You brought a Harvester with you," he says, gesturing to Xoti. "It must have been the dreams."

The other pilgrims look to you with a mix of apprehension and hope.</DefaultText>

Just then, [Specified 3]'s strength fails him. The wagon's corner slips from his grasp and the wheel slams down on the misaligned board - landing on the young man's hand with a sickening crack. As he cries out, the wheel slides off of the board and even deeper into the mud.

Several of the Dawnstars glower at you and mutter to each other.</DefaultText>
