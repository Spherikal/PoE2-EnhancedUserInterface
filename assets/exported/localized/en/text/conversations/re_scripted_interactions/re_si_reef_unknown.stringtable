      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] finds you on the main deck. Your navigator is holding a compass the same way one might hold a moldy piece of fruit.

"Captain, there's something wrong. The needle's twitching like a scarab's leg, but there's nothing about this place on the charts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your helmsman deftly guides the ship between them. 

Along the way, you spy the remains of boats that were not so lucky.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>...but a snag catches at the hull. [Specified 4] cries out as the wheel wrenches free from the sailor's hands. [Specified 0] grabs the wheel, guiding the ship towards deeper waters.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The sailor swears as the ship shudders, its hull dragging across the sharp adra. The bucking ship throws [Specified 5] over the rail and into the water below. You look down to see the school of a thousand fish descend upon the hapless deckhand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 4] points ahead. "Reefs, captain. Some ships cross them to save time. We can try it ourselves, or we can go around."

[Specified 0] sighs. "With our instruments acting like this? I say we sail around this place - whatever it is - however long it takes."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Head bowed, [Specified 5] mutters quietly. "In hiding, the Obscured imparts revelations. Mayhap the god of secrets has marked this place for a reason."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you sail above the reefs, a faint light shimmers in the depths. At first, the glow barely reaches the surface, but it gradually brightens, its source rising closer... something that looks like a submerged mountain peak. 

You recognize it as a vast shelf of luminous adra.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Peering overboard, [Specified 1] whispers. "...the eyes of the Eyeless Face..."

Just below the surface - and surrounding your ship - you glimpse a host of eyes watching you.

As they flicker, however, the eyes resolve into thousands of fish, their silver-and-blue flanks marked with black spots like pupils.</DefaultText>

      <ID>18</ID>
      <DefaultText>At last, the shoals and adra recede behind you, and the eye-like fish give up their pursuit. [Specified 0] checks the compass - now pointing faithfully north - and breathes a sigh of relief.</DefaultText>

      <ID>19</ID>
      <DefaultText>A sound like thunder rends the air, and the deck comes apart beneath your feet. For an impossibly long moment the world spins around you, and then you plunge into the water.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] finds you on the main deck. The sailor presents a compass, expression utterly baffled.

"I think the damn thing's broken, captain..."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] stares out at the sea. "The shadow of Wael falls upon us, peering through us to pierce the depths."

[Specified 0] blinks blankly at [Specified 1].</DefaultText>

      <ID>26</ID>
      <DefaultText>[Specified 3] grins. "It's in good repair, captain. I wouldn't sail through a reef myself, but if there's a good time to try, this is it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 3] frowns, eyes running across the planks of the deck. "I suppose we could take a knock or two. Not that I'm recommending it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a steady hand, you guide [Player Ship] across the reefs. It slips through gracefully, though you hear your crew mutter as they spot the remains of ships that were not guided by the hand of the divine.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You open your eyes to find the crew staring at you in a mixture of awe and trepidation.

"Sometimes I wonder just what we've gotten ourselves into," [Specified 0] says. [Specified 4] merely nods.

[Specified 1] grins and turns away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You hang in the water, stunned, pieces of lumber and steel sinking around you. Too weak to swim, you watch the surface recede.

Darkness claims you.</DefaultText>
