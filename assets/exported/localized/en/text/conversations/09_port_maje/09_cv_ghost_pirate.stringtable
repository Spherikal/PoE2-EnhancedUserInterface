      <DefaultText>"I'd say that's a damn shame, but you seem to be gettin' along well enough on your own.

"Benny's crew, I swear, we get up to some right nonsense. Most fun I've ever had on a boat - 'cept for all the hangovers. You ever been hungover at sea? I don't recommend it, no sir."</DefaultText>
