      <DefaultText>As you approach Yngfrith, she tenses but does not run. Her eyes go wide when she meets your own, shoulders high with a hunted look etched into her long face.

Modwyr strains in your grasp, pulling desperately toward the figure in the crowd.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I had thought, I hoped to never -"

She rubs a shaking hand across her eyes, which are red-rimmed and bloodshot.</DefaultText>

      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You said you would come back for me! But you never did."

Modwyr's voice is unsteady, strained. It pulls toward Yngfrith as if it were a needle and she a lodestone.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was no fault of yours. It is I who am to blame."

Yngfrith kneels and lays a scarred, tentative hand on the flat of Modwyr's blade.

      <ID>23</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It was shame."

Yngfrith runs her fingers lightly down the length of the blade. Modwyr leans into her touch, warms beneath it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When I... left... him, I took Modwyr with me. I thought it was my responsibility to look after it.

"I decided that my penance for Modwyr's creation would be to hunt those who used animancy for terrible ends."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>27</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I fled for Deadfire, to the Príncipi, but I was too naïve to know that shame has fleet feet. It devoured me.

"I thought if Modwyr were gone, I might finally be free of my shame. How foolish I was."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I don't remember my life before, so I can't hate you for stealing it from me. I don't know if I will ever be able to forgive your betrayal, but..."

The sword leans heavily on Yngfrith, pressing its hilt into her thigh.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Yes, I think that's best."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>30</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But I care for you as well, [Player Name]." The sword leans away from Yngfrith and toward you. It presses into your leg.</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"As it should have always been." Yngfrith gives you a tight, close-lipped smile and grasps the sword's hilt.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"You're right - after what I've done, I have no claim to it." Yngfrith grimaces. She glances once at the sword, then quickly away.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>You feel a featherlight touch on your mind. Countless voices swell, and their ethereal tongues speak only apologies.

Then, like the breeze, they're gone.</DefaultText>

      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>With a solemn nod, Xoti swings her lantern back and forth, chanting indiscernibly under her breath until a waft of purple essence lifts from the sword. It slams into her lantern, rattling the metal frame with such intensity, Xoti swears and fumbles it to her chest.</DefaultText>

      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>You touch the flat of the blade, and it does not warm beneath your palm.

You close your eyes and listen closely, and you do not hear the murmuring swirl of consciousness beneath the surface as you once did.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yngfrith takes the sword gingerly as if unsure what she should do with it. She touches the flat of the blade, relief and regret playing across her face.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>53</ID>
      <DefaultText>The barest hint of a whisper brushes at the back of your mind. Though you can't make out the words, you can feel the voice probing carefully at your thoughts, subtly pressing on your desires.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>54</ID>
      <DefaultText>The whisper builds to a chorus of voices, and soon you can hardly think for their collective din.

You are possessed of an immediate, intense conviction that you must return to your ship.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The force with which you repulse Yngfrith's intrusion buckles her knees, and she collapses to the ground, groaning.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>57</ID>
      <DefaultText>She rests her forehead on her knees and tries to breathe deeply, but she can't quite catch her breath.

After a moment, she looks up - not at you, but at Modwyr.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Yngfrith's body cools on the boardwalk before you. Blood from her wounds runs between the wooden boards, dripping down into the sea below.

With an anguished cry, Modwyr leaps from your hands and lodges itself in Yngfrith's corpse. Try as you might to remove it, Modwyr will not budge.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I was born a cipher. As a young woman, I was apprenticed to a master animancer.
