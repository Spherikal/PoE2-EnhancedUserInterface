      <DefaultText>"You been getting a lot of sleep so far on this trip.

"I'd have woke you but you looked so peaceful with your face in the sand."

Edér runs his fingers through his hair and removes a strand of seaweed he finds lodged there. He examines it closely and then tosses it onto the sand.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You wake to the sound of waves, and the taste of sand in your mouth. You have survived the storm, washed onto an unfamiliar shore.

In the sand around you lies the scattered debris from the wreckage of the Defiant. Nearby, you spot a familiar stone bust.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Difficult to say for certain. The Deadfire is spotted with islands, some quite small. 

The good news is that, if the storm hasn't spun us round entirely, I'd say we're in charted waters. I believe the Vailian Trading Company operates in the region."
