      <DefaultText>Slumped against the stones of the bridge, a giant clutches at his bashed-in chest. It's a mess of sinew and blackened iron bones, fiery blood flickering between his splayed fingers.

      <DefaultText>He closes his ember-hot eyes, a relieved sigh rushing from his chest as you brew up and then tip a vial of poison to his lips. The icy, slushy mixture takes effect immediately, dousing his flames with a sweep of hoarfrost through his veins. It leaves his face cold and ashen and dead. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Extinguished or crushed... us all... defiler..."

      <DefaultText>The Rathun glowers as you approach, dagger glinting from the light of his flames. 

He grasps for you with a meaty, blood-burned hand, but his swipe is clumsy and weak. You effortlessly shove his arm to the side before stabbing the knife into his already ruined chest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You twist the blade, slicing again and again while he grunts and slumps further against the gritted stone at his back until he moves no more - nor makes a sound - his hands lying limp on the ground.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Xoti swings her lantern back and forth over the warrior's body until a large, shimmering cloud of essence sifts up and into her lantern. She grunts, the lantern dipping in her hand as if heavier momentarily.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A right good action you did there, cap. Here's hoping we don't be ending up needing that poison, though..."
