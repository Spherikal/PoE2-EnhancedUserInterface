      <DefaultText>"What is this?!"

Pallegina has just finished rifling through her pack. She opens her palm to reveal a carved wooden statuette of Ngati.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Lady knight, do you have a moment?" 

Tekēhu touches his brow. The gesture seems more reverent and submissive than usual.</DefaultText>

He pulls out an identical figure.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Postenago! Why would you think I want anything to do with her or the rest of those bazzos?!"

Pallegina winds back her arm and hurls the figurine as far as it will go with a hateful grunt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Blinking, Tekēhu clutches his figurine over his heart. He bites his upper lip and looks to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Cruel?! The gods made me this way and I've cursed them for it since before I knew how to give form to words. I want nothing to do with them and &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; one is stuffing my pack with their relics."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Forgive me captain. Pallegina..."

Tekēhu swallows and nods to you both.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>31</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Ekera, I was mistaken to think we... shared something. Because of this." Tekēhu gestures from his head to her head, frowning to himself.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina's jaw stiffens. Her golden eyes widen and hold firm with Tekēhu's until he blinks and glances away.</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"The bitterest of rivals would not leave things as I did. I would make amends." 

He opens his palm and concentrates, a bead of sweat rising on his brow.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>36</ID>
      <DefaultText>The ambient moisture coalesces in the air over his palm, taking the form of a ship very much like the one on the flag of the Vailian Republics. Once the sculpting is done, Tekēhu lets out a breath and snaps the fingers of his free hand. 

Confident that the tiny water sculpture will hold its shape, he passes it to Pallegina. </DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"If it is not to your liking, the waterform will collapse in... minutes. I simply thought-"</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I admit, it is... exquisite. It have only seen such detail on the finest marble statuettes from Gualfi."

Though Pallegina shows genuine admiration, she seems annoyed to be feeling it.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That was thoughtful, Tekēhu."</DefaultText>

      <ID>42</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I was wrong to press you, lady knight. We deal with our heritage differently."

He inclines his head to her again.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"When I was born, there was no celebration. I was seen as an ill omen. That is, until my parents could get me out of their sight."

Pallegina sighs, exhausted just by speaking of it.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I appreciate the gift, Tekēhu. Will it... last?"</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>45</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It will have to be maintained, but... for you, I will do this, I say." Tekēhu's lips part in a grin.</DefaultText>

      <ID>46</ID>
      <DefaultText>"These old pages are a winding trail between our minds. But they are only the beginning of a longer path, ekera?" </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>47</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Lady knight, I will say my prayers in a softer voice if they offend you." 

Tekēhu lowers his head and raises a shaking hand to touch his brow.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>48</ID>
      <DefaultText>She holds up a feathered hand and briskly shakes her head. In her other hand, she presents a well-worn book. The cover is stained and torn, the binding so cracked that a leather strap is tightly wrapped around the book it to hold the pages inside.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>49</ID>
      <DefaultText>Pallegina steps to Tekēhu's shoulder and loosens the strap. She opens the book quickly but delicately, as though she has done it a thousand times. Her fingers gingerly turn from page to page as Tekēhu looks on.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"When I was a young girl training with the brotherhood's cadets, I wanted so badly to escape. I couldn't, so I stole a book from the scriptorium and started drawing in it."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>51</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Would you... help me to read the words of your beautiful tome? My grasp of Vailian is not what it could be." </DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>52</ID>
      <DefaultText>"That was a very kind gesture, Pallegina."</DefaultText>

She smiles warmly.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Pallegina nods and smiles before gently placing the tiny water sculpture in her pack.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>64</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Then ours will be a journey well-spent, friend Pallegina." 

Tekēhu inclines his head wearing a proud smile. </DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>66</ID>
      <DefaultText>"&lt;i&gt;Who&lt;/i&gt; put this in my pack?!"

Her golden eyes look first to you, but slowly turn toward Tekēhu as her lids narrow accusingly.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>67</ID>
      <DefaultText>"But you could not have known. I was too harsh with you."</DefaultText>

      <ID>68</ID>
      <DefaultText>"It took me ages to scrape off whatever he had been writing in it. I don't know what it was. I couldn't read then. But I filled the leaves with pictures."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>69</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Where are these places?"

Tekēhu's eyes rapidly sweep across each page as Pallegina turns it.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>70</ID>
      <DefaultText>"They are nowhere. Everywhere. Places that were anywhere I was not. Because to be godlike means to be alone."

Pallegina steps around Tekēhu and takes his shoulders to look him squarely in the eyes.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>72</ID>
      <DefaultText>"To be godlike in the Deadfire is different, I say... but not necessarily better." 

Nodding, Tekēhu sighs and rests his hands on Pallegina's. They hold the look until they both simultaneously pull back. </DefaultText>
