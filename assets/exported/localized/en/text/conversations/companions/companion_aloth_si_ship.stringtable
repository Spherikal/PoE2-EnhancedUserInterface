      <DefaultText>You are rounding a rocky islet when you see a ship drifting on the horizon, its sail luffing in the breeze.

A rough symbol has been painted onto it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>But you do spot one body slumped against the gunwale and another splayed over the wheel. 

And an arrow buried in the mast.

Aloth appears at your side and looks as well. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"That symbol - it looks like a variant of the Leaden Key's insignia."

Aloth lowers the spyglass.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think they're Leaden Key?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Or attacked by them, perhaps.

"Leaden Key members rarely announce themselves in such bold fashion. But we won't know until we look," Aloth says.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Please, [Player Name]. It could be nothing, but if they are Leaden Key, they might point us to the Painted Masks." 

Aloth furrows his brow, twisting the spyglass between his hands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Too bad. We've got bigger problems."</DefaultText>

      <ID>16</ID>
      <DefaultText>"And if we don't look now, there's no telling where that ship might drift. Or who might get to it first." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Aloth says nothing but watches the ship as you sail past it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pull out your spyglass and peer at the symbol. 

It's crudely-drawn, but it looks like it could be a war club. Or a sword.

Or a key.

Other than the flapping sail and swaying lines, you don't notice any movement.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It looks to me like the war club of the Wahaki tribe. They paint this on raided ships to warn others, I say." 

TekÄ“hu folds his arms and shivers.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>22</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps. Still, it merits a closer look."</DefaultText>
