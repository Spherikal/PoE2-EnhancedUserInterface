      <DefaultText>Out of nowhere, a heavy fog rolls over the ocean, so dense that you cannot see more than a dozen feet out from your ship. With the fog's arrival, the winds die. The waves calm. And [Player Ship] is left aimlessly drifting, the only sounds that of the hull groaning as if in dread of what's to come.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eerie green lights pierce through the fog as the silhouette of a massive galleon approaches. Black sails, though tattered and rotting, catch in an otherworldly wind, slicing the ship forward at a rapid pace.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"What the goddess of Death has marked, I will leave untouched." She nods solemnly, once, then with a tilt of her skull, steers the ship away.

As the Floating Hangman turns, several undead sailors shamble across the deck, hungry for a look at your crew. They scratch at the chipped and rotted railing, heads rolling on their exposed spines.</DefaultText>
