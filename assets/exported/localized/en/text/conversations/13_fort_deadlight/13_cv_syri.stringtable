      <DefaultText>The orlan's large eyes grow larger as you approach, then narrow to a sharp edge. Her hands briefly ball into fists before finding their way to her hips. With a sharp twist of her head, she flips seaweed green hair over one shoulder. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Whiteleaf's rare as an honest sailor in these parts, so Captain Aeldys keeps it locked up tight. Only breaks it out for special occasions."

      <DefaultText>&lt;i&gt;Slick wet fur in the lamplight, calloused palms perusing her pelt, tweaking teats and biting at the soft edge of the neck, thrusting into hotness... yet tender - hopeful - not that this time will be the one that lasts, but that she might forget this sodden shithouse for an evening or two.&lt;/i&gt;</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I might've said things to Syri when I last dropped anchor at Deadlight. Just lovers' words, savvy? But I can't say I rightly lived up to them. I ain't saying there's a problem... just a possible wrinkle in the old charts."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Fucking aye, I'm upset. Got every cod-crushing reason to put sixteen plugs of lead in yer furry blue ass and see how ye sink." Arms crossed, Syri taps her right foot a smidge faster than the tempo of the music.
