      <DefaultText>Sun-blistered and rawboned, the pirate regards you both with a discerning glare. She tongues a chapped bottom lip but keeps quiet.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well? Spit it out, Selinia. And try not to embarrass me before our guest."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Course, captain. Hit my head pretty hard near the end, but I'll spit the tale best as I can."

The pirate touches a spot at the base of her skull and winces. She glances off to the side, eyes black and full of hurt. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Dying's all anyone's reliable for. Just the when and how of it's the question." 

She sighs, fingers kneading at her neck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It branded the back of my eyes, that moment... High seas. Nothing but blue all around. Then... mist so thick you could taste it. Ship sailed from within. Out of nowhere."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Rotted. The crew, they were all undead. Couldn't stop them from boarding, couldn't kill them. Couldn't even fight them in the end."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"There is a flag the Floating Hangman flies, a flag that once heralded the Fonferrus of Old Vailia. It belonged to a Darcozzi paladin of some legend, one Lucia Rivan."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"But Selinia's knowledge is limited in this regard. Let us instead ask her of a subject she may know."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"One of mine found her no more than a week ago, malnourished, dehydrated. The poor girl was scarcely able to speak."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Well, I'm more than able to gabble now, aren't I? Could sail, too. Know you got no reason to keep me."

She flits her hands over the softness of her shirt.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Calling me craven? Sure, I am." She snorts.

She rubs at the back of her head, rough, like she needs it to hurt. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Selinia cuts a glance to Furrante for confirmation. When he dismissively waves her away, her black eyes narrow and she raises her chin, defiant. But then he turns his full gaze to her, suddenly seething, and she shrinks in on herself. 

Fists shaking at her sides, she reluctantly retreats.</DefaultText>

With a shiver, the pirate turns her black-button eyes to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"- skimmed right out. It was too late. We couldn't out-sail it."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Don't know, me. Drifted for days, maybe longer. Kept winking in and out after I ran out of drink."</DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Perhaps there is something else you wish to ask of our guest before she... departs from us?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Again, her fingers hesitate close to her hip, the fabric crinkled there, where a pistol might normally be strapped.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Was a hunt. Not for loot, but for bodies. The ship, it looked..." 

She gropes at her hip, but there's nothing there. Fingers fumbling at the air, she bares her teeth.</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"...kinder than most."

Selinia pointedly avoids Furrante's gaze, a grimy hand scrubbing at her mouth.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Was some magic, foul. Just sudden-like, the winds died. The waters fell flat and the air got heavy. They turned sky and the sea both against us."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I dropped a dinghy and rowed for it. Don't know why they didn't give chase. Don't much care, me."</DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>"She belongs to Aeldys, who undoubtedly will come to claim her soon. But that is a problem for another time." Furrante sighs.</DefaultText>
