      <DefaultText>A tunnel along your path has collapsed, a giant rock its new immovable door. Laborers mill about it, but there seems little actual labor occurring.

You might be able to find another way through the city, but the detour could take hours.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You direct your companions around the stone. With a series of heaving groans and the popping of joints and muscles, your group rolls the stone out of the way, opening the path beyond.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You pass the workers. The largest stone fell at an angle, suggesting you might be able to leverage it free.

Finding the holes and gaps in the stone, you widen the tunnel’s opening until you can pass through.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"DARK HOME IS NEW HOME!" tears a shrill voice before you, a screech from one of the many imps crowding the tunnel. "LEAVE!" 

They flock forward, hideous cave bats fleeing before them... and towards you.

The Huana scatter in terror, leaving you to the beasts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With your group's help, you're able to move the largest of the stones fairly efficiently... perhaps too efficiently. 

A piece of hanging escarpment falls from above, cracking across your back and shoulders. 

"Ngati below." The foreman winces. "Want to rub dirt on it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] organizes the work but accepts the brunt of the heavy lifting. Soon, the massive stone growls over the smaller rocks beneath it, powdering each one with a satisfying crunch. The tunnel entrance howls softly as the wind begins to carry through it once more.

One of the workers cheers, but the foreman slaps him upside the head.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] organizes the work, and while it takes time, your group manages to clear the debris. 

As you admire your handiwork, a chunk of escarpment breaks free and drops on [Specified 0]'s head, sending your ersatz foreman sprawling.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You leave the workers to their unenviable task. 

The streets twist like a kraken's tentacles, but you've traversed Neketaka's districts enough times to know the land's lay. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Getting around the tunnel shouldn’t be any harder than going through it, you thought, but Neketaka proved you wrong.

A few unhelpful locals, dead ends, and hours later, you finally bypass the tunnel. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A musty wind whistles across your face, a seaborne stench on its breath, bearing a bleating clamor from the darkness - a cacophony of mindless chittering and chirping. 

For a moment, you think you hear someone snapping their fingers...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Roparu mutter among themselves, but grow quiet and avert their gazes at your approach.

The Kuaru foreman glances up from a slat of palm and raises a hand. "Greetings, noble Watcher. We work to fix this tunnel, but for now then, the way is closed." He bows his head. "The servants of Neketaka always apologize for any difficulty or delay."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>One of the Roparu shakes his head. "Surely you felt it, ekera! A great dragon went and flew over the island! It shook the whole city!"

The Kuaru frowns at the speaker and waves the aumaua off. "You go be quiet." 

He returns his attention to you. "They know better than to blunt their teeth at their betters. The servants of Neketaka always apologizes for any inhospitality or offense." 

He provides another obsequious bow. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The foreman's eyes widen, and several workers take a step back from you. Their boss turns, slapping one across the back of the head.
"People got to get through that tunnel! We open it! Now!"

The workers grumble, one complaining that it'll take days to break through.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The foreman nods. "Ekera, the Watcher spoken true."

      <DefaultText>You step forward and place your hands against the rock. With an incredible display of strength, you push against the stone, which rolls to the side, clearing the path. 

You step back and brush clean your palms as a throng of slack jawed laborers look on.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A confusing network of natural and kith-hewn tunnels run between the Brass Citadel and the Gullet. 

Most of the larger thoroughfares are well-traveled and familiar, but the narrower branches that spread from them are a confusing muddle of twisting halls and dead ends.</DefaultText>
