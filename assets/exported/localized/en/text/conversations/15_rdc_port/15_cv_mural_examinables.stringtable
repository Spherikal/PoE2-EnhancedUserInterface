      <DefaultText>A small plaque below the mural reads: "The Winding Serpent was our first success. Born of the common barracuda, we subjected the creature to the machine's vital energies, and it grew to immense proportions. It has since appeared to have developed something of a group mentality, often hunting in packs."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The plaque is worn, but still legible: "The Barbed Ravager was the direct result of our success with the Winding Serpent. We grafted poisonous barbs onto bull sharks and subjected them to the machine's energies. The creatures tripled, then quadrupled in size, assimilating the barbs into their bodies. And so a most fearsome predator was born."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A plaque near the mural reads: "The Leviathan was a folly born of purest hubris. After our experience with the Barbed Ravager, we decided to test the limits of the machine's growth capabilities. We entrapped a pod of blue whales and subjected them to the machine for months on end. Only a few of the creatures survived, but those that did... 

"They could not be contained."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The plaque below the mural is in remarkable condition. It reads: "The Kraken is a beast like none other. By applying the manipulation techniques we refined through our work on the Leviathan, we increased both the size and intelligence of the common octopus, and they have since proved themselves to be ferocious hunters.

"There was one unfortunate side effect, however - they also became quite territorial."</DefaultText>
