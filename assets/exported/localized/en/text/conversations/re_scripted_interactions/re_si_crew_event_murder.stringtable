      <DefaultText>A quick series of knocks rap against your door. [Specified 3] stands at the portal, a clamor growing on the deck beyond.

"Pardon me, captain, but we have a problem." </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With a cheer, the sailors march across the boat to pitch the murderer overboard. When they lift [Specified 1] up, the gag flops free of her mouth, and she screams her innocence. But then she's overboard, nothing but a muted splash and a few quiet shouts.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The rope zips across the railing with a searing whine before snapping taut. The sailors retreat to the stern of the ship and fish out a bloody and unconscious figure.
 
[Specified 1] lives still, and by the code of the sea, the punishment is done.</DefaultText>

      <ID>8</ID>
      <DefaultText>The sailors boo the decision. You squeeze the whip, wringing blood out of the leather thongs, and tell everyone to get back to work. 

[Specified 1] hangs insensate against the mast as [Player Ship] sails on.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The rope runs free until a knot clogs the winch, leaving [Specified 1] to be dragged somewhere under the hull where beds of barnacles grow. A froth of flesh and blood starts to bubble and twist in the stern’s wake. 

You tell the crew that the murderer is dead and to cut the rope.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Captain!" [Specified 0] thrusts a thumb at the accused. "We found [Specified 1]'s own belt around [Specified 2]'s neck! I don't know about you, but my belt only unbuckles for shitting and fucking. Maybe that isn't city proof, but we're on the open sea with no doors to close between us and a murderer!"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You know well as anyone that orlans are half-crazed with bloodlust at the best of times!" [Specified 0] grabs [Specified 1] by the scruff and thrusts the orlan forward. "There's blood on this one's yellow little teeth! Think it got there all by accident?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 4] chuckles, then blinks. "You're not serious, are you, captain?"

[Specified 0] scowls. "The captain's serious, all right. Cut the lucky fool loose." The other mates make to free [Specified 1]. "None of us are going to sleep right after this, captain. I wonder who'll get the strangling next?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>On deck, you see [Specified 1] bound and gagged. [Specified 2] lies against the bulwark. A couple of crew members crouch nearby, tears in their eyes as they lay a shroud over the corpse.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>With gravitas, [Specified 3] hands you the whip, a horse hide handle bearing flails of layered leather, each punctuated with shark teeth and fish hooks. 

[Specified 0] and [Specified 4] hold [Specified 1] in place. Neck craned, the condemned looks desperately towards you, screams muffled by the gag.</DefaultText>

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>With each of your lashes, the whip’s prongs bite into [Specified 1]'s skin and catch, requiring a tug to pop them back out. 

Three lashes in and [Specified 1] passes out. </DefaultText>

      <ID>44</ID>
      <DefaultText>You look back at the crew, let the whip out again, and take up the flogging. Again and again, the barbs bite into [Specified 1]'s back, tearing free chunks of flesh and spattering the deck with blood. 

You don't stop until ribs and vertebrae show among the viscera. You turn away, leaving the corpse to your ashen-faced crew.</DefaultText>
