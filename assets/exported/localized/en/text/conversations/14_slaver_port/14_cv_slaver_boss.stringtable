      <DefaultText>Footfall echoes behind you, approaching steadily, louder and louder, until Master Kua steps directly onto the bottom landing. 

The firelight dances across his face - his features a disturbing twist of darkness and inhumanity. Without so much as a word, he wrenches a lever at his side, and a portcullis slams down, locking you within the dungeon.</DefaultText>
