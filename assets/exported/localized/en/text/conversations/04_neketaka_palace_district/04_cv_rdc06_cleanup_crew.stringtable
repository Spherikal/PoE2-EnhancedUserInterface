      <DefaultText>"The prince has fled, but there is little he can do now. The queen is dead, and the seat of power in Deadfire is ours." 

Coming from him, this is a simple statement of fact - you detect no triumph or elation in his manner.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Atsura watches you for a long time, deciphering your response.

      <DefaultText>"It's a terrible shame, this dreadful waste of life. 

"Still, the skirmish here will forestall much longer, bloodier battles in the future.

"After all, why fire a volley when a single shot will do?" There is no pleasure in his smile - only a sense of finality.
