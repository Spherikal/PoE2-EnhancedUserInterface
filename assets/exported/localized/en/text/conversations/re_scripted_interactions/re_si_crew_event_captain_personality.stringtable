      <DefaultText>"Well..." [Specified 0] frowns at the deck. "Rations have gotten low of late. Things like that can get a mariner to thinking a kith isn't fit to be captain." The sailor coughs. "But a show of face can sometimes set things right."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crew straighten, stiff and moving only with the sway of the ship. None risks a glance at the others. A bead of sweat runs to the tip of [Specified 0]'s nose, then drips to the deck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 3] chuckles. "I don't suppose that means it's our turn for a nap?"

      <DefaultText>The crew blink, hesitating briefly before they scatter to their posts, grabbing up ropes, hammers, and mops.

      <DefaultText>Muttering spreads among the crew as they look to one another in disbelief.

"Pray it isn't Ondra in there," [Specified 1] quips, eliciting nervous laughter.

      <DefaultText>Quickest to straighten is Edér. So uncharacteristically responsive and formal is his movement that the rest of the crew seems to take notice, and more readily follow suit.

For his part, Edér looks genuinely surprised at the way his body has responded to your command, seemingly of its own accord. A smile flickers on his face before he is able to find composure.</DefaultText>
