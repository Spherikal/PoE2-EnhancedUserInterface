Beyond this cloud of essence you feel the pull of the cycle, a force that steadily increases. This pillar remains steadfastly blocked from the natural flow.</DefaultText>

You pull yourself back toward your body before the force rips your soul away.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You animate the corrupted essence into a destructive force, ripping the space around you apart.

      <DefaultText>Power still hums through the essence. Sending it through the cycle would restore the adra around you.

Fragmenting it would detonate the delicate balance of power, destroying the pillar.

Either way, the steady tug of the Beyond grows. You must decide quickly.</DefaultText>
