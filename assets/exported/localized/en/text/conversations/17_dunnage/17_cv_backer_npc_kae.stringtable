      <DefaultText>You find a woman of early middle years dressed fine - if dirty - armor adorned with bright purple piping. A pair of long scars bisect her brow and jaw.

Though she stands at ease, a nervous energy thrums through her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"With pleasure! Teaching is my specialty, after all. I'm going to pack your brain with so much knowledge, you're going to have a headache for a &lt;i&gt;week&lt;/i&gt;.

      <DefaultText>She starts first with the practical training - how to move silently through bush, when and how best to hide, how to step so as to muffle the sounds of your feet.

Satisfied, she moves on to a high level explanation of various theories of knowledge. She seems to have quite a passion for epistemology, and goes on for an excruciatingly long time before at last sending you on your way.</DefaultText>
