      <DefaultText>As you ink records of your recent journeys in the log, you lift your quill and are rewarded with near-silence. You listen, but you make out only the crackle of candlelight, the creaking of timber, and the soft spray of the sea against your windows.

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] steps forward and you rotate to the right. The mutineer tracks you, circling as you maneuver them against the portside railing.

"A strange feeling, isn't it, captain?" [Specified 0] asks. "Facing the consequences of-"

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] lines the mutineers up and counts down the line, assigning each a number. The loyal sailor produces a die from a pouch and tosses it onto the deck. It clatters to a stop.

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] walks to the portside and looks overboard, running a finger along its railing. "Yeah, I think I could run this operation considerably better."

You glance at the mutineers. This is about as good of a chance as you’re going to get. With a quick sprint, you clear the distance between you and [Specified 0]. By the time the bastard looks up, you plant a boot in their gut. Stumbling backwards, the mutineer bowls over in pain.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The mariners' clothing curls in the wind, lifting from gaunt frames like flags from poles. Hollow faces stare at you in union from deep eye sockets under furrowed brows. [Specified 0] coughs before speaking.

"You step out here with crumbs on your jacket and the scent of spice on your breath." 

[Specified 4] takes up the cause. "We haven't eaten for days."

"Just listening to our guts grumble." Head shaking, [Specified 3] frowns. "Fighting over stale crumbs, hunting bilge rats…"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] tosses a mug across the deck, the wood clattering and scratching across the planks. It bounces to a stop against your foot.

"We’re sailors, captain. Without a drink of water to enjoy, not a draught of grog to soothe our scrapes and sores, not a sip of rum to wash away our cares."

Scowling, [Specified 2] nods. "I'd spit, but I haven't got the saliva."</DefaultText>

[Specified 2] chuckles quietly, nodding in unison with [Specified 3]. [Specified 4] smiles broadly, glancing at other mates as if calculating each one's worth in silver.

"How’s that for ‘diplomacy,’ captain?" [Specified 0] asks through a wry grin.</DefaultText>

"Let them go," [Specified 0] says. "They wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for me. I take full responsibility for this."

[Specified 1] looks at you. Diplomacy wouldn’t work if you backslid every time. You spoke for peace...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] glances back to the others. "Let’s get to it."

Before the mariner can turn back, you draw your pistol and fire. [Specified 0]’s forehead craters and skull shards scatter on the air. Smoking mush lops from the brainpain as the mutineer crumples to the deck, blood pooling across the planking. An eye rolls lazily towards you before slowing to a stop.

Your eyes shift to the others through the smoke from the gun barrel.</DefaultText>
