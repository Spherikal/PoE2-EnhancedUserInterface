      <DefaultText>Thick smoke, black as death, plumes from the peak of a rumbling volcano, the largest in the chain of mountains that makes up Magran's Teeth. A serrated fissure gapes in the mountainside, deep and dark but intermittently lit by a red-hot glow.

      <DefaultText>The skiff sways tumultuously in the superheated water the closer you row to the cave's cracked opening.
