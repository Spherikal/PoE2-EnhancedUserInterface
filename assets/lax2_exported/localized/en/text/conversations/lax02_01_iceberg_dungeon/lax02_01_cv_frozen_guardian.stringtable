      <DefaultText>What you initially take for yet another frozen corpse, appears, on closer inspection, to be a heavily armored figure encrusted in a jagged layer of cloudy bluish ice.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The angle of the joints indicate that the warrior once gripped something tightly - something since removed. Deep scratches in the wrists suggest that someone clawed at the figure long after it froze over, perhaps to remove the absent object.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two of the fingers have been broken from the hand. Based on the hard, sharp edges of what's left, it seems this occurred after the figure froze over.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Layered chain and plate - highly adaptable to varying circumstances - often proves popular with those travelers who can afford it. Members of military or religious orders in particular favor wearing armor like this kind with their uniforms or vestments. 

The set before you appears to be of a style not commonly crafted in the past two centuries.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As delicately as you can, you take a chisel to the straps and the edges of the armor, chipping away the ice holding it in place. 

You loosen the gear, but it remains frozen in place.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You grasp the breastplate and pull. When it doesn't give, you set your feet and heave as hard as you can. With a crack that echoes off the walls, the breastplate comes free... along with the elf's torso. 

The halved elf slips from your grip, striking the ground, where it shatters into ragged chunks.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The figure stands straight, shoulders a bit forward, as if against a strong wind. The posture bespeaks a deep resolve in the face of terrifying force.

The upraised hand seems to be warding against some threat.
