      <DefaultText>The land here is shattered and barren, eerily quiet, with jagged hillocks plunging abruptly into the calm, clear seas. No birds fly above, and you've not spotted the first boar, rat, or lizard.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you advance, the flaps on two of the closer tents open, disgorging a lithe wood elf in Aedyran finery, a bulky aumaua with cerulean skin, and one of the savannah folk, who levels a large crossbow at your heart. "Not another step, stranger," he says.

The elf smiles warmly at you, rather mixing the message.

The robed figure within the camp makes no movement at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You accept a bowl of the stew - it's bland, with little texture to its ingredients - and pass the rest of the evening among the odd quartet, eventually retiring to one of their offered tents.

      <DefaultText>As you make small talk with the adventurers, Zandran meanders about the camp, looking over the watch, checking on the stew, and so forth.

      <DefaultText>You spin a wild tale of the many sicknesses and maladies that plague the orphaned children of a village on the other side of the mountains to the south. By the time you're finished, both the dwarf and the Vailian are openly crying.

You're returning that way, you tell them. If they have anything they could spare - for the children! - you'd be happy to deliver it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The campfire’s fire flickers in the large eyes of the elf. The two men step between you and her, the one with the crossbow grinning.

"A shame," rasps a tinny voice from the hooded figure. "Kill them all, and take whatever you find." 

The robes fall to the ground - empty - and melt into shadow...</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A small group approaches, a motley band of kith bearing quality arms and armor.

The foremost, a deeply-tanned dwarf, raises a hand in greeting. "You're coming down the pass?" she asks. "Don't suppose that means you've dealt with those filthy eotens, does it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You step into the camp and come to sit beside a fire. Although it looks like they intended to put it out before you got there, the aumaua feeds it another log. 

The dwarf gestures to a pot hanging over the flames. "Got some stew left. Fish and vegetables, nothing fancy."</DefaultText>

The band's orlan makes her way to you. "Warmth and welcome are free. Soup and sleep'll cost you, our relationship being so transactional and all." She gestures to a pot hanging over the fire and the tents beyond.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>By comparison, the camp ahead positively bustles. Horses are tied off to stakes, a robed figure - cowl pulled over its head - sits upon a crate, and the scent of a hearty stew wafts from the pot hanging over the small campfire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The trio guide you among the tents - there seem too many for the few kith you see about. The elf graciously offers you a seat at the fire. The robed figure makes no apparent notice of your arrival, their cowl casting their visage in impenetrable shadow.

      <DefaultText>Keeping low and behind the robed figure, you make your way towards the camp fire. You're passing the first tent, absolutely assured in the silence of your movements, when a savannah folk levels an arbalest at your head from your left.

      <DefaultText>You lean away from the campfire with a long yawn and spot some open bags beside a tent. Something flickers back at you, reflecting the flames. 

You excuse yourself from the campfire and work your away around the encampment. You find plenty of small items to secrete into your pouches before returning to the others.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Zandran breaks your gaze, turning her attention to the campfire.

"Her dog died," Lyslódhir states simply, as if noting the weather.

The dwarf winces. "Fang's a wolf - not a dog - and a good one besides. I keep him with me." She rests a closed fist between her breasts. "Always will."</DefaultText>
