      <DefaultText>Beetles are not quite folk-sized, but they still strike a sufficiently intimidating form to frighten off most travelers. The largely uninhabited swathes of the Deadfire Archipelago give beetles plenty of room to multiply. The most successful species of large beetle have evolved to not only camouflage themselves in the surrounding environment, but also to grow carapaces made out of common and hardy materials such as wood, stone, and adra.

Despite all appearances to the contrary, there is an underlying complexity to the common beetle. When they choose a material with which to develop their shell, they do so with a level of intention that borders on artistry. Wood beetles will often bore intricate holes in their carapaces. By blowing air through these makeshift pipes, they play an eerie music to attract mates. Stone beetles fashion rudimentary tusks and horns that help them to defend themselves and to attack prey. The intricacies of adra beetles are as of yet not well understood, save that they are notoriously difficult to kill.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Phantoms are souls that did not properly separate from the body after death. This usually happens as a result of severe trauma, particularly in the case of a violent death. Unlike lost souls, which are incapable of interacting with or being detected by normal mortals, phantoms (like shadows and cean gŵla) maintain a connection to the physical world. They will attack other life forms without discrimination.

Phantoms can also manifest from kith who lived particularly chaotic lives, including violent criminals and the insane. Anyone can become a phantom under the right circumstances, but the fear of phantoms - and their association with the mentally ill - can result in vulnerable populations being shunned across many communities.

      <DefaultText>Ogres are large, thick-skinned creatures, standing between ten and twelve feet tall. They are heavily muscled and typically attired in the furs or skins of their prey. Clubs, axes and maces made of bone or wood are their preferred weapons. 

Despite their natural intelligence, ogres' volatile temperaments have historically prevented them from concentrating long enough to create anything of significant cultural value. Most live semi-nomadic, secluded lives in the wilderness, where they are less likely to encounter others. The only time they reliably come together is during the mating season, which often does almost as much to reduce their numbers as it does to replenish them. Ogres with a more "peaceful" streak take particular pains to avoid contact with others of their kind.

On the rare occasions that ogres are found working together, they are almost always operating under the direction of an ogre matron. Ogre matrons are even larger than male ogres, but tend to be less aggressive toward their own kind. Where ogres have banded together, they have often represented an insurmountable threat to other kith.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shadows are created when creatures with heavily fractured souls die without re-entering the cycle of rebirth. Because these souls are damaged, they drain essence from other creatures in a futile attempt to repair themselves. The more essence they steal, the more powerful and dangerous shadows become. As they devour essence, they pick up pieces of corporeal matter, giving them a visible, if indistinct, form. Luckily, shadows can only draw a small bit of spiritual energy from souls still attached to a body or bound to an object. They mainly rely on creatures like the pŵgra, who can draw souls out of their physical form, to help them obtain the essence they crave.

Shadows have been known to draw spiritual energy from people while they sleep when their souls are not bound as strongly to their bodies. This results in horrible nightmares that leave the person in an exhausted state the next day. If an entire town suddenly begins to suffer nightmares, it is highly probable that a strong shadow has taken up residence there.

Since shadows absorb spiritual energy, they appear invisible to creatures that rely on spiritual sight. This has led to experiments in binding shadows to armor or other objects to act as a cloak to obscure those who do not wish to be seen by such creatures.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Young dragons begin their life cycle as wurms, though most never develop beyond that stage. Wurms are clever and sly, but not especially intelligent. To develop into a drake - and eventually a dragon - a wurm must have ample space and resources. They will not develop if they live near existing drakes and dragons. They must seek out a habitat that has not already been claimed by a larger counterpart.

Since the chances of further development are low, most wurms will band together in covens for survival. Yet they remain bold and highly aggressive creatures, so the covens they form tend not to last long.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Enormous and hostile spiders come in a terrifying array of shapes, sizes, and colors throughout the islands of the Deadfire. Much more aggressive than their tiny kin, these giants actively seek out human and animal prey. Even the weakest of them, the spear spider, can easily kill a grown kith if the victim is unprepared. Though the spear spider lacks a poisonous bite, its piercing legs, from which its name is derived, can inflict terrible wounds, even through armor.

More deadly than spear spiders are ivory spinners and widowmakers, both of which possess horrific, poisonous bites. The ivory spinner also has the ability to fire webbing at its prey, slowing it down. Widowmakers do not cast webs, but their poison is extraordinarily toxic.

Seldom seen outside of the most remote locations, the fabled crystal-eaters are enormous and powerful, possessing magical abilities some wizards believe have been developed through the consumption of adra and enchanted gemstones. In addition to their ability to raise a field of deadly crystal spikes, the venom of a crystal-eater will temporarily turn a victim's flesh and blood to stone. Subsequent attacks by the crystal-eater on a petrified foe are quickly fatal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lurkers are comprised of a colony of several different species of parasitic, carnivorous plants and fungi working together to hunt a common prey. As a whole, they stand nearly ten feet tall in a vaguely anthropomorphic "body" comprised of vines, leaves, roots and earth. The coexistence of so many separate organisms makes them hardy and difficult to eradicate - it is usually best to sever the parts that enable locomotion or, should their victim possess fuel and lack finesse, to simply light the entire colony on fire.

While the means by which lurkers form remains something of a mystery, some speculate that they form when certain species of flesh-eating plants come together on a common host, such as the hollowed-out victims of dank spores, and that they achieve locomotion once sufficiently colonized. This theory is supported by the fact that many lurkers contain bones and other remains riddled with roots and spores when cut open.

Lurkers are notorious for hiding in plain sight, often waiting motionless amongst the trees and underbrush to ambush their prey. They appear to hold a rudimentary intelligence and are at least sophisticated enough to store food. It is not uncommon to see several unconscious victims tangled in a lurker's vines to be saved for a later feeding.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lions thrive in the lush forests of the Deadfire, particularly in the more arid regions of the archipelago. More populous than their peers in the Eastern Reach, Deadfire lions nonetheless struggle to maintain a foothold in region due primarily to recent incursions by colonial forces, who hunt them for sport.

In addition to their great power, lions are known for their roar, a terrifying sound that can strike fear even into the hearts of the bravest kith.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These giant mushrooms stand nearly as tall as adult aumaua and are topped by a broad and colorful cap. Their enormous weight is only held upright by the dozens of roots surrounding their base.

Dank spores are unique among their kind in their appetite for the souls of living creatures. They often grow and move in groups along the forest floor, searching for weakened or exhausted travelers who are unable to fend off their attacks. Once they find a host, they bind to it and supply it with the basic nutrients required to keep it alive while they absorb its essence. Dank spores are extremely hostile once they find a host - they will attack anything that gets close to their meal with their poisonous, barbed roots.

Dank spores feed on the most corrupt and splintered energy of a soul first, continuing until the host is nothing but a soulless husk. This makes dank spore flesh useful to experienced apothecaries as a cleansing agent in soul purification medicines and techniques. Improperly applied, however, this treatment can lead to amnesia and, in extreme cases, soul fracturing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Sporelings are the larval form of dank spores. While more mobile and agile than their mature counterparts, these humanoid-shaped creatures are also far weaker. They spawn from dank spores and use their heightened mobility to seek nourishment. Like dank spores, sporelings feed off of both decaying organic matter and soul essence, and they must bulk up on a sufficient amount of both before maturing into dank spores themselves.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These gangly giants stand twice the height of average humans. Their bodies are covered in large fungal growths that leak foul-smelling, pus-like fluid. Their oversized hands and feet extend to giant claws capable of rending a kith in two. Dozens of slimy tendrils hang loosely from atop their oversized heads, and their vast maws are filled with jagged, razor-sharp teeth. They have never been observed to use weapons, tools, or clothing, likely because they do not need them.

Looking at a troll, it can be difficult to tell whether they've evolved in harmony with lichen, moss, and fungi, or whether they've been overtaken by them. A troll's naturally clammy flesh provides the ideal growing environment for these plants. They provide camouflage as well as some protection from the elements, and the enzymes they produce also offers limited sustenance for trolls in lean times.

Because of their symbiosis with these plants, trolls generally dwell in heavily-wooded areas, although some may occasionally be seen in damp underground environments that also house an abundance of lichen and fungi.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The vithrack are extremely rare and dangerous creatures with natural cipher abilities. They are mostly humanoid in shape - though slightly taller and thinner than humans - and boast fanged, spider-like heads. Similarly to spiders, they are capable of spinning silk. Rather than creating webs, they use this skill to fashion complex hive structures along with their own very intricate and fine robes.

Male and female vithrack are indistinguishable from one another. They are primarily spellcasters and mental manipulators, like ciphers, though they will also attack with their fangs when forced into close quarters. A vithrack's psionic powers allow it to communicate mentally with others of its kind. Like many social insectoids, their society includes a variety of specific roles, including scouts and defenders.

Despite their intelligence and power, vithrack are not a major force in the world due to their low birth rates. While their difficulty conceiving is likely responsible for their famed hostility toward other races, it have also made the vithrack highly altruistic when it comes to young of their own kind. They will defend their nests to the death.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>These amorphous clouds roil and swirl with violent energies. Within the maelstrom, dozens of humanoid shapes materialize and vanish within an instant. Faces scream in silent agony while hands desperately clutch and claw at the air around them.

Bîaŵacs, known as spirit winds, often create blights. If souls are ripped free of their bodies and caught in the center of the storm, they may stick together and become bonded with available elemental substances in the maelstrom. They are beings of pure chaos and confusion, and destroying them is considered a mercy to the souls trapped within. 

Experimenting with blight creation is yet another questionable activity that has earned animancers a bad reputation in many circles. Some see it as dangerous and inhumane, others as a means to an end. The creation of blights is an accusation many fearful kith level at animancers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>A delempŵgra ("rotten leaf"), more typically called pŵgra ("rotten"), is a delemgan that has been corrupted by the destruction of their home tree or adra stone. They are as ugly as delemgan are beautiful, spindly and emaciated with cool tones to their skin. Their hair is dead, dark, and slimy, their facial features contorted, and their teeth long and sharp. Unlike delemgan, they are not surrounded by motes of light, and they are more than willing to attack unfortunate travelers with their long talons. Pŵgra decorate themselves with the skulls, skins, and feathers of animals they've killed.

Just as delemgan seek to maintain the health of their forests, pŵgra seek to corrupt them, making the two species mortal enemies. The rot that infects them endows their attacks with a ghastly poison, but it also makes their bodies weak and brittle, leaving them vulnerable to piercing and crushing attacks. 

Since they can no longer draw essence from a healthy forest, they must survive by drawing energy and essence out of plants, animals, and kith. This makes them natural allies of shadows, which feed by similar means and enjoy the benefits of a shared hunt. 

They are hostile toward all life, but rangers and druids are their most common foes.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The delemgan are forest spirits bound to adra monuments or ancient - often petrified - trees. They appear to have mostly elven-shaped bodies, but their skin is made of wood and their hair is long and plantlike. As their name suggests, adragans, or "adra-born" as they are sometimes known, appear to have skin made of adra. Delemgan glow slightly and often have tiny motes of light around them.

Delemgan are entirely magical beings and as such do not use physical weapons to attack. They retain the overall shape of humanoids, but do not wear clothes and lack sexual organs. Their attractiveness is used in tandem with their magic, typically to mesmerize attackers or lure them to their deaths.

These creatures draw their essence from their surroundings. While they have physical bodies and can be killed if those bodies are destroyed, their survival is inextricably linked to the health of their environment. They feel no natural animosity toward other beings, but they will defend their territories with a surprising ferocity.

Delemgan may individually be more or less hostile depending on the well-being of their locale and on whether kith they're previously encountered have proven to be dangerous or benign. They are traditionally friendly toward rangers and druids. Their spiritual link with trees has led to greater understanding of the link between rangers and their animal companions, though a definitive connection has yet to be made. 

Delemgan are a natural hindrance to large-scale development. While they usually live peacefully alongside rural communities, towns and cities with an eye toward expansion may find themselves beset by hostile delemgan. While rural kith usually oppose the destruction of delemgan habitats, city-dwellers often support the notion, believing that the delemgans' souls will simply reincarnate in other forests or back into kith.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Dragon is both the name for the creature and the short title for the mature stage of its life cycle. Dragons are remarkably long-lived, persisting for hundreds, if not thousands of years, and go through three stages of growth before reaching their final adult form - egg, wurm, drake, dragon.

Dragons become larger, stronger and more intelligent as they grow older. Adult dragons are powerful and impressive creatures, often dozens of feet long with commensurate wingspans. Their intelligence frequently surpasses that of most other sentient beings, including humans.

Despite dragons' solitary nature, they are revered as deities by xaurips, who often build their communities around a dragon's lair, aiding in the much larger creature's defense and sustenance.

Like drakes, mature dragons adapt to suit their environment, but do so much more extensively. Their coloration, ornamentation - and, to a limited degree, body structure - will reflect their chosen territory, as will some of their attacks and defenses. Because they have already claimed territory and rarely face a threat from other dragons or drakes, they are more conservative in nature and will not seek unnecessary conflict.

Only dragons can mate. This is generally the only occasion that will cause a dragon to leave its lands or seek out others of its kind. Upon reaching the dragon stage, these creatures will assume a sex. However, if surrounding populations are too heavily skewed one way or the other, individual dragons are capable of changing their sex. As creatures that reach this stage are so rare, this ability is critical to the survival of the species.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Drakes represent the middle stage of a dragon's life cycle. They have developed from wurms, but have not yet reached - and may never reach - the dragon stage. Drakes will aggressively defend their territory and seek to expand it as much as possible. Drakes are actively hostile against other drakes, as they represent competition for scarce resources.

Their coloration reflects the territory they have claimed. A drake living in a swamp, for instance, may be shades of green, brown and black, and possess nictitating membranes, a flat snout, and raised nostrils. While all drakes can breathe fire, many also develop alternate breath attacks, incorporating other elements.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An ooze is a mobile, carnivorous mold that develops in secluded, dark, and dank places. Oozes feed off of ambient bacteria, fungi, and small insects as they grow. They begin to seek larger prey, including humans, once they reach the size of a dog. 

Like all living creatures, they have a measure of soul essence, but their lack of intelligence and a true nervous system makes them mindlessly aggressive and thus difficult to deter. Their viscosity and mobility enable them to perform surprisingly nimble attacks, and they are capable of "spitting" corrosive enzymes to break down flesh and armor.

Some of the more dangerous variants of the species are disease vectors, making any confrontation with them especially perilous.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wisps primarily inhabit abandoned ruins and other such forgotten places. They are thought of as curious creatures, for they sometimes follow travelers for short distances for reasons known only to themselves. While typically peaceful, wisps are notoriously aggressive if provoked and will viciously defend their territories if they perceive them to be under threat. As a result, wisps are often described as the weeds of the spirit world - small, quick to regenerate, and nearly unstoppable in large numbers.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Animats were initially created to serve as guardians for royal tombs. Their earliest creators bound the souls of their strongest warriors and servants to intricate sculptures, which were made of various materials in accordance to the rank of the soul captured within. As the knowledge of the technique for this process became more widespread, powerful animancers started creating their own animats to serve as personal guardians, using whatever weapons and materials lay at hand. 

Animats can only be created through the use of loyal souls that hold a powerful dedication to protecting their charges. While the ritual to create them can still be performed upon unwilling subjects, a lack of resolve in a participant's soul can result in abominations which immediately attempt to destroy themselves in a violent manner, often inflicting collateral damage in the process. Even successful creations remain vulnerable to the onset of doubt, and most animat creators take great care not to allow such doubts to manifest.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Darguls represent the first stage in the irreversible decay of a dead body that is sustained only by soul energy. In this state, darguls have lost some portion of their memories and mental abilities, but still retain enough self-awareness to recognize their own decline.

Their hunger for living flesh is so insatiable as to make them reckless. They are more aggressive in their pursuit of kith than even fampyrs, yet crave secret and secluded environments where they can eat their prey without inciting the wrath of civilized communities.

Some fampyrs dread this stage more than those that follow, for they know they will likely possess enough of their faculties to fully appreciate losing of them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Fampyrs are kith that have had their lives unnaturally extended. Though they retain most of a normal humanoid appearance, they are merely a few missed meals away from devolving into mindless monstrosities, and they know it. As fampyrs maintain individual personalities and memories, this morbid knowledge may manifest itself in a number of ways. Some may become reclusive and cautious, avoiding any threats that could prematurely weaken or destroy them, and others become outgoing hedonists, seeking to enjoy every pleasure the world has to offer while they can. Sooner or later, every fampyr will inevitably succumb to decay unless killed.

Because fampyrs require living essence in order to stay alive and the blood of kith provides the richest and most immediate source of it, they are shunned by most civilized communities. As a result, fampyrs tend to live at the fringes of society, if they participate in it at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Like animats, flesh constructs are created by animancers and powered by a captive soul. Unlike animats, they are not dependent on the will and loyalty of the bound soul. Flesh constructs, therefore, cannot be undone by doubt, but they are only capable of following simple instructions. They also tend to be shorter-lived than animats. Whereas the energy and faith in an animat's soul can sustain it for decades, even centuries, the soul bound to a flesh construct will gradually fade away from its physical form, and the body will eventually stop responding to the soul's energy. Opponents of animancy in general and soul constructs in particular see this as a soul's rejection of an improper body, and as evidence that flesh constructs are an abomination.

Even among animancers, the creation of flesh constructs is controversial. Some see the process as a "soul lobotomy" and believe that a soul should be allowed to pass on to the next life rather than be used as mindless fuel for a body.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is generally understood that guls retain enough cunning to make dangerous hunters and adversaries, but not enough to be concerned about their rapid deterioration. Like darguls, they are drawn to secluded environments, though some gravitate towards cemeteries in search of readily available flesh. The meat of dead kith satisfies some of a gul's hunger, but it does little to sate their need for soul essence. Inhabiting a graveyard may actually hasten a gul's decay, as it reduces their incentive to seek out living sources of food. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Skuldrs are large, mammalian creatures that dwell in caves in total or near-total darkness. As a result, they have poor vision and rely on their sense of hearing to navigate and find prey. The protrusions and hairs on their ears allow them to detect airflow, which is key to telling direction in an underground environment. They communicate through screeches and clicks, and use these vocalizations in a form of echolocation. They are communal creatures who will nest and raise young together. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Xaurips are reptilian humanoids about the size of orlans. They adorn themselves with the bones of fallen enemies - mostly xaurips from rival tribes. They also have an affinity for large feathers, which they hang and pin to their attire. Xaurip skin tones can vary from light green to a rustic brown. Their elongated snouts - which make speech impossible - and overly-aggressive behavior have hindered them from communicating with the more docile races of the world. They live in secluded, tribal territories and are known for ruthlessly attacking anyone foolish enough to cross their path.
 
Xaurips revere dragons as deities and build their communities around the lairs of these powerful creatures. It is not uncommon for a small tribe to wander nomadically until it has found a drake or dragon to worship. Once a tribe dedicates itself to a dragon, they will defend it at all costs.

Elaborate rituals, in which the dragon consumes xaurip sacrifices, are a normal practice. As a dragon grows in age and size, these sacrifices become large religious events that cost the lives of hundreds of xaurips.

The power and prestige of a xaurip tribe directly correlates with the age of its dragon. The most powerful tribes have existed for hundreds, if not thousands of years. Warriors and shamans of these large tribes typically paint their bodies to resemble the coloring of their draconic gods.</DefaultText>

When an attack is made, the Accuracy is compared to a corresponding defense (Deflection, Fortitude, Reflex, or Will) on a target to determine how the attack roll will be modified. If Accuracy is above the target's defense, it will be more likely to result in a Hit or Crit, less likely to result in a Graze or Miss.</DefaultText>

      <ID>146</ID>
      <DefaultText>There are four defenses in Pillars of Eternity: Deflection, Fortitude, Reflex, and Will. Each defense is used to resist a different category of attacks through the Attack Roll. Deflection is used to resist most direct weapon attacks or attacks that are similar to weapons. Fortitude opposes physical attempts to overpower a character or attack their body internally (e.g. via a poison). Physical area effect attacks like fireballs and lightning bolts are resisted by Reflex. Almost all mental attacks are opposed by Will.

Fortitude, Reflex, and Will are all based on pairs of attributes. Might and Constitution define Fortitude, Dexterity and Perception define Reflex, and Intellect and Resolve define Will. Base Deflection is defined by the character's class and Resolve. All characters gain flat bonuses to their defenses every level. Additionally, spells, abilities, afflictions, and items can all modify a character's defenses.</DefaultText>

      <ID>148</ID>
      <DefaultText>Afflictions are groups of negative effects that can be applied to a character. Most Afflictions are grouped by Attribute. E.g. Hobbled and Immobilized are both Dexterity Afflictions.

Attribute Afflictions can be easily countered by a corresponding Attribute Inspiration, which also grants immunity to that category of Afflictions. E.g. any Dexterity Affliction can be removed by the Quick, Nimble, or Swift Inspirations.

Some characters are completely immune to one or more Afflictions. If a character has Resistance to a category of Afflictions, incoming Afflictions of that type are downgraded in power. Resistance grants complete immunity to the weakest Afflictions of that Attribute.

E.g. wood elves have Resistance to Dexterity Afflictions. A wood elf hit by an Immobilized effect would instead be Hobbled. If that elf were hit by a Hobbled effect, it wouldn't apply at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>All attacks in Pillars of Eternity compare the attacker's Accuracy value to one of four defenses: Deflection (direct melee and ranged attacks), Fortitude (body system attacks like poison and disease), Reflex (area of effect damage attacks), and Will (mental attacks). 

A number between 1 and 100 is generated and added to the difference between Accuracy and defense to determine the attack results. Less than 25 = Miss, 25-49 = Graze, 50-99 = Hit, greater than 99 = Crit. 

In a balanced Attack and defense scenario, the majority of attacks wind up being Hits or Misses. When Accuracy is superior to defense, more Crits are likely. When defense is superior to Accuracy, more Misses are likely.

By default, only some attacks are capable of Grazing, unless an ability or effect would otherwise grant it. If an attack lands in the Graze range, but cannot Graze, it will become a Miss.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>158</ID>
      <DefaultText>When an attack hits, there is one primary means of mitigating damage: Armor Rating.

Armor Rating value is usually derived from armor, but many creatures have natural AR or can raise it through the use of magic, Abilities, Talents, or other equipment.

Armor Rating is compared against the Penetration of oncoming attacks to determine the attack's overall effectiveness.

Full Penetration (130% Damage) occurs when Penetration is twice the target's Armor Rating or more.
Partial Penetration (100% Damage) occurs when Penetration meets or exceeds the target's Armor Rating.
Under Penetration (-25% Damage per point under the target's Armor, Max -75%) occurs when Penetration is less than the target's Armor Rating.

Note that many suits of armor and many creatures will grant different Armor Rating values against the different Damage Types. Lower ARs protect less against that type of damage, making the target more vulnerable to attacks of that type.</DefaultText>

Damage that is not reduced by a character's Armor Rating goes straight to their Health. Potions and healing magic (such as from a paladin, priest, or druid) can restore Health in combat. When a character's Health reaches 0, he or she will be Knocked Out. A Knocked Out character can be brought back in combat through the use of a Revive ability. Otherwise, characters will regain all of their Health at the end of combat (assuming they're on the winning side).</DefaultText>

For example, all weapon proficiencies grant modal abilities that are available when the proficient weapon or shield is equipped. Similarly, a paladin's Zealous Auras can be set to one of three different states.

Modal abilities should be changed based on the tactical needs of a combat. For example, if a character would not benefit from the additional Penetration of a sabre's Windmill Slash, it should be turned off to improve the character's Recovery time. A paladin may wish to use Zealous Charge at the opening of a battle but switch it to Zealous Focus to gain more Accuracy once the fight is underway.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>There are eight damage types in Pillars of Eternity: Slash, Pierce, Crush, Burn, Shock, Corrode, Freeze, and Raw. Damage types are used to determine how easily a target resists damage of that type based on their Armor Ratings. A creature or suit of armor may be very resistant to one type of damage but quite vulnerable to another. 

Some weapons or attacks may do multiple damage types or list an "or" between their damage types. When an "or" is listed, the attack will always do the damage type that the target is most vulnerable to. Raw damage is the only damage type that ignores all Armor Ratings and is generally associated with poisons and similar effects. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Extraordinarily rare, death guards are sometimes created upon the demise of a particularly determined individual who refuses to leave the physical world for the Beyond. Paladins are most susceptible to this terrible transformation, but priests and other exceptional zealots often suffer the same fate.

Death guards occupy their former bodies, but the energy that allows the soul to remain in the physical world rapidly consumes the flesh, leaving only bone behind. They are often driven mad by their state and are terrifying foes to behold, striking fear into those unlucky few who encounter them.

When fampyrs wish to avoid the gradual decay associated with their condition, they can engage in a risky, expensive, and extremely painful process that separates their tissues from bone and leaves a perfectly aware skeleton behind. In this case, essence does not decay in the flesh and instead resides in bone, a much hardier substance. Since the newly created death guard requires virtually nothing to survive and will not naturally decay further, it can "live" until it is killed.

Their limited connection to the Beyond allows them to summon fearsome balls of flame, summon shadows, and even slay the living with a word.</DefaultText>

      <ID>203</ID>
      <DefaultText>Engagement can be acquired from Spells, Abilities, Talents, or by wearing a Shield.

Engagement occurs any time a character attacks an enemy with a melee weapon at close range. As soon as the attacker gets close enough, he or she will Engage. When a character is first Engaged, he or she will stop moving. The character is free to move around their engager, but moving away will provoke a Disengagement Attack. If characters break Engagement, there is a limited amount of time before that enemy may re-Engage them.

Some afflictions make it impossible for a character to Engage an enemy. All Might Afflictions prevent the target from Engaging anyone, as well as Paralyze, Petrified, or Prone effects. Each of these effects will automatically drop Engagement and can be used to get out of trouble.

Some creatures, especially large ones, may be able to Engage more than one creature at a time.

      <ID>205</ID>
      <DefaultText>Flanking occurs any time two attackers Engage an opponent in melee from opposite directions. When this situation exists, defenders are Flanked, inflicting various penalties and allowing them to be Sneak Attacked. Any condition on an attacker that would break their Engagement will also remove the Flanked condition on the defender if it cannot be sustained without them.

Note that there are a small number of Abilities that grant exceptions to the standard flanking rules, such as the barbarian's One Stands Alone, the ranger's Stalker's Link, and the cipher's Phantom Foes.</DefaultText>

      <ID>207</ID>
      <DefaultText>Stacking rules control how bonuses and penalties are added together. For simplicity, the game distinguishes two source categories of bonuses: &lt;b&gt;passive&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;active&lt;/b&gt;.

Most passive bonuses come from equipped items (including weapons and shields) and passive abilities. If an effect has no duration and does not need to be turned on or off, it generally is considered a passive bonus. &lt;b&gt;All passive bonuses stack with each other.&lt;/b&gt;

Active bonuses come from spells, items, and abilities that must be activated. This includes modal abilities that are toggled on the action bar, such as weapon modals, paladin auras, and a fighter stances. &lt;i&gt;Active bonuses use the highest bonus to a statistic and suppress all equal or lower bonuses.&lt;/i&gt;

E.g., if a wizard spell grants +3 to Deflection and a paladin's aura grants +5, the highest active bonus is +5, with the +3 being suppressed. If the same wizard spell also granted a bonus to Dexterity, it would apply unless it was &lt;i&gt;also&lt;/i&gt; trumped by a superior Dexterity bonus from another active/modal source.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Food is required to rest in most wilderness and dungeon areas. Many inns, taverns, and merchants, will sell Food, but basic edible ingredients can occasionally be found in containers or on enemies. While resting a character must consume Food to partake in the rest, doing so will clear any Injuries and refresh Per Rest resources.

While edible ingredients are a source of commonly available food, prepared meals can be crafted or purchased and will provide much greater bonuses to a character after resting, (though they may be expensive).</DefaultText>

Lockpicks are a special type of tool that is used for picking locks. If the character's Mechanics is high enough, lockpicks are not required (and not used up) when picking a lock. However, for challenging locks, you may need to sacrifice some lockpicks to succeed. As with other tools, the lockpicks do not need to be in an individual character's inventory.</DefaultText>

This means that all of the statistics of the weapons still apply, including the damage and other effects that they provide. If two weapons are used in this way to perform a Full Attack, each weapon will deal less than full damage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lagufaeth are territorial, four-armed amphibians. Though their thick skin protects them from the cold climate of the White March, their native land, they tend to favor hot springs and consequently feel right at home in the sultry waters of the Deadfire Archipelago. Lagufaeth are communal wilder with rudimentary weapons but a natural aptitude for magic. They are especially dangerous in the mountains, where storms and snowfall may hide their presence from travelers until it's too late. They can remain under ice for extended periods of time and have been known to surprise unwary fishermen.</DefaultText>

Sages believe that the ritual is the first step for a cure for undeath.

      <DefaultText>A series of fallen Pargrunen territories that were settled by dwarves in the earliest colonial years of the Eastern Reach. The most prominent settlement, Durgan's Battery, was well-known for its high quality bronze art objects and unparalleled steel weapons, shields, and armor. Over several decades, the White March's various settlements were either overrun by myriad raiders or collapsed due to growing fears of instability. The stronghold of Durgan's Battery was apparently abandoned and sealed almost two centuries ago, marking the unofficial end of the White March.

The arms of the White March can still be seen on fine pieces of bronze and steelware circulating in the Eastern Reach. The symbolism of the mountains is obvious, but the linked circles at the top were common to many Pargrunen settlements, representing the common link of kinship between them. The yellow field, not often found on metalwork, indicated the bronzeware that the White March was initially famous for.</DefaultText>

Their society is complex enough to make interactions with other kith a possibility, but the Nāga have never entertained cooperation as a viable alternative to violence. Nāga adhere to a strict religious doctrine that mirrors the Wheel in many aspects, though focuses prominently on the Nāga's superiority above all other creatures.

Within Nāga society, they divide up individual roles around a mixture of born traits, cunning, and ambition. Nāga possessing few talents above the ability to grip a sword are consigned to the warrior class. The most venomous and keen-eyed Nāga are trained as skirmishers or elite commanders. The spiritual and intellectual Nāga are either instructed into the role of shaman - or fight their way into it - likely spending much of their career defending this status against competitors.</DefaultText>

Known as the rotghasts, these are the corpses that continue to roam, stinking and rotting, skin sloughing from bone while host's own innards flourish an infestation that steadily consumes from the lungs out. The first stage of incubation progresses as a welling of a thousand worms from the guts to the tongue, enabling transmission through regurgitation and watery-discharge. 

Later stages of the nesting cycle involve bulging, easily-burst tumors, blackened blood, worms writhing through the skin, and the complete loss of motor functions.

      <DefaultText>Grubs are burrowers and scavengers capable of subsisting on little more than the moisture leeched from rocks for their entire lifespans. Hunting larger prey only serves the most basic need of storing energy for the expenditure it takes to carve out vast networks of tunnels and colonies for nesting. However imposing, these creatures leave most of the backbreaking labor of expanding the colony to grublings. Mature grubs tend to retire from outward expansion, instead taking on the task of maintaining and protecting the heart of a colony and the grounds reserved for breeding. Their corrosive saliva is used as a tool of construction and predation, numbering cave grubs among Eora's most efficient and adaptable hunters. </DefaultText>

Sandworms are ambush hunters, prepared to wait extended periods of time beneath the sands for a hapless meal to wander by. Their diet is limited only by their size - given a robust supply of prey, sandworms can grow to be truly formidable.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Based on their quality and the locations where they were first discovered, animancers theorize that Engwithan titans were fashioned to guard sites of vital importance. Their longevity and state of preservation would suggest that a titan's vigil has no ending condition, and that they were simply expected to maintain their orders until physically no longer able to do so. Animancers who have attempted to uncouple titans from their directive swiftly learned that the ancient commands are hardwired into the titan's very being, and that no manipulation will be tolerated.
 
A core of glowing adra rests in the titan's chest. This channeler of spirit energy either houses a very old and stalwart soul or possesses a means of replenishing itself. Animancers have used this example to bring animats to a semblance of life and awareness, but their results lack the consistency and capability of Engwithan craft.</DefaultText>

As befitting the importance of their task, only the most elite and respected Engwithan men and women contributed their souls to the guardian vessels intended to last for all time. Eternal service to the cause of reincarnation was seen as the ultimate expression of self-sacrifice, as these esteemed individuals deserving of the highest honor would never partake in the cycle they lay down their existence to defend. Consequently, saints are more powerful and zealous than their cousin titans, which are rudimentary constructs by comparison.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Eotens feature in the most grotesque of folk tales. Once merely the most aggressive and unstable of ogres, eotens have since developed into massive monstrosities that are both larger and far less intelligent than their cousins. Eotens have two heads, one notably smaller than the other, and when the larger of these is incapacitated, the smaller retains just enough brute cunning to keep an eoten fighting until either it - or its prey - is dead. It's common to encounter their kind with rotting skulls dangling from their neck.

An eoten's unpredictable temper and total inability to conform to ogre society brand it an outcast. Ogre males or females who produce eoten offspring are forbidden from breeding again, and their unfortunate progeny are either killed on the spot or left to the mercy of the wilderness. The latter is undoubtedly what has led to mature eotens being found in rural areas, much to the detriment of easily preyed upon livestock.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Many Huana worship Berath as Rikuhu, the twin eel god that represents the cyclic connection between overworld and underworld, life and death. Rikuhu is often depicted with the two constituent eels: Kohopa, representing the overworld and life, and Tangaloa, who represents underworld and death, devouring one another by the tail.

In Huana folklore, Kohopa and Tangaloa were born before time existed, and each had an insatiable appetite. They began to devour all living things, and with each thing devoured, they became larger. When there were no living things left to eat, and the two eels were so enormous as to encompass all existence, they began to devour one another. Thus, all beings are perpetually passing through the digestive tracts of the two eels. When one reaches the end, it passes through the mouth of the next eel - the gateway to or from the underworld - and the next stage of existence begins. The notion of time is merely one's perception of the digestive process.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The In-Between" refers to the shadow world that souls (briefly) wander after death on their way to the Beyond. It has been described as a hazy landscape, empty but for the glow of other souls, adra, and Watchers. This is the space that Watchers peer into when they observe and speak to lost souls and soul fragments. Even the gods cannot reach it.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Grand Vailia was a sprawling and culturally rich empire with Vailian colonies settling far north and south of Eir Glanfath. However, problems with the empire's Aedyran expansion efforts, along with a steep economic decline, led the Vailian colonies to secede in 2641 AI, establishing themselves the Vailian Republics, a confederacy of allied city-states. 

For the next century, Grand Vailia collapsed into Old Vailia as more and more nobles and their retainers fled the empire, many of them immigrating to the Deadfire. Initially trying to survive as merchant ships, these immigrants eventually descend into piracy as their trade networks decayed and were taken over by nascent Vailian and Rauataian colonies.</DefaultText>

Krakens rarely venture to the surface, and they almost never leave survivors in their wake. They are massive, tentacled beasts, capable of crushing small ships and plucking sailors from their decks. Despite their size, krakens' soft, flexible bodies allow them to squeeze through tight spaces in search of prey or shelter. Thankfully, they prefer dark, quiet spaces to open water.

They are cunning hunters and, according to legend, Ondra's terrible servants.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>When a damaging attack hits a target, the attack's &lt;b&gt;Penetration&lt;/b&gt; is compared to the target's &lt;b&gt;Armor Rating&lt;/b&gt; to determine how much damage gets through.

Penetration comes from the weapon or spell that is being used, but can be raised through the use of magic, Abilities, Talents, or weapon enchantments. Penetration is compared to the Armor Rating of the attack's damage type. E.g. A Fireball will always check Penetration against Burn Armor Rating. Raw Damage bypasses all armor and does not need to penetrate.

&lt;b&gt;Full Penetration&lt;/b&gt; (+30% Damage) - Penetration is twice the target's Armor Rating or more.

&lt;b&gt;Penetration&lt;/b&gt; (Listed Damage) - Penetration meets or exceeds the target's Armor Rating.

&lt;b&gt;Under Penetration&lt;/b&gt; (-25% Damage per point under the target's Armor, Max -75%) - Penetration is less than the target's Armor Rating.

      <DefaultText>"A wizard's first foe is ignorance. Her second, pride. Her last? Mortality." - Maura of the Seven Hills

Some wizards seek fame, others fortune. Many seek both. For those whom neither will satisfy, there is immortality. Few wizards possess the knowledge to grasp at eternity, and fewer still the fortitude, because the cost is steep indeed: one must sacrifice one's soul.

Neither living nor dead, a lich retains their mental acuity but does not hunger for the flesh of kith as undead creatures do. To avoid the decay of undeath, a wizard must bind their soul to their body. However, the process for doing so is unpleasant in the extreme. First, they must carve a series of intricate runes into their skull, then overlay that with a complex net of spellwork, and finally complete the transformation by boring a hole into their forehead that they then plug with a large piece of adra.

What drives a wizard to become a lich? The reasons are as varied as the wizards themselves. One might fear death, while another might fear being bested by a rival. Still another may desire only the ability to continue their work, amassing ever greater knowledge of the nature of essence and the runes and incantations required to master it.

Whatever their reasons, all liches develop the characteristic form of their kind as their bodies rapidly wither and age. Their skin grows thin, almost translucent, stretched across their bones like a thin film of algae spreads across a pond. What hair remains runs white. Their body cools until its touch holds all the warmth of glacier ice. In the end, only their magic, might, and malice remain.

If a lich's body is destroyed, they become a void seer, a floating skull.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though they may appear indistinguishable from a normal vine, assassin vines are anything but. They are primordial creatures, beasts that have existed in Eora for as long as kith - or longer - and are very strange indeed.

In fact a collection of plant vines subsisting in a tightly interwoven colony, assassin vines demonstrate both an unusual and alarming degree of sentience. For example, they have been known to lie in wait for their prey in the shadows of low-lying plants. When their target passes by, the assassin vine whips out from its hiding place, knocks its prey to the ground, constricts them, and drags them back to its lair for an agonizingly slow death by crushing and the application of certain liquefying enzymes.

Assassin vines are not only formidable hunters - they are challenging opponents in combat, too. They prefer to crush their adversaries to death, but if their foe is out of reach, will settle for tearing thorns off their own body and hurling them at their opponent.

What lies at the heart of an assassin vine nest is, as yet, a mystery. None who have been so foolhardy as to attempt to find out have returned alive, let alone in one piece.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>In the days of old Ukaizo, there lived three dragons. As servants of Ngati, they swore to protect the islands and adra of the Deadfire Archipelago with the aid of the Huana who ruled there. This agreement served both the dragons and the Huana well for countless decades.

And then the Engwithans arrived.

The Engwithans were quick to endear themselves to their Huana hosts, and together these two great societies constructed machines across the archipelago with the power to sort, sequester, and destroy souls. Many thousands of Huana willingly sacrificed themselves to aid in the machines' creation, for they believed the Engwithans' project to be a noble one.

The Engwithan machine built at Ukaizo was the most precious of them all. Knowing they would need a guardian to protect it, the Engwithans entreated the three dragon servants of Ngati with an offer - the Engwithans would grant the dragons eternal life at the cost of their eternal service. The dragons thus allowed the Engwithans to tether their souls to a single beast, the Guardian of Ukaizo, and rejoiced in their new, undying form.

But the Guardian of Ukaizo's celebrations were to be short-lived. When the Engwithans sacrificed their society on the altar of apotheosis, the god who would become Ondra called down a great storm upon the city of Ukaizo and the surrounding islands, so intent was she to hide the evidence of the Engwithans' ascent to artificial godhood.

And so it was the Guardian of Ukaizo became the keeper of a dead city, bound in body to forever protect a place that no longer existed.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Skeletons are creatures who no longer require flesh or essence, but whose drive to kill has been instilled over many stages of progressive decay. As a result, they will attack anything that approaches them, but they won't attempt to consume it after it is slain. The essence that animates them is energy at its most basic level, as the skeleton has lost all measure of will, intelligence, or personality. If not killed, a skeleton may eventually grind itself into bone dust, or its essence may finally evaporate into the ether.

Skeletal savants are the remains of warriors, wizards, and other adventurous types. They are similar in overall properties to other skeletons, but they are more capable in combat and often retain rudimentary skills from their adventuring lives.</DefaultText>

Left to their own devices, clusters of drakes will vie for dominance over habitats in high demand, naturally culling the weak and leaving only the strongest and most intimidating examples of their species to thrive for centuries, if not millennia. Suitable nests are therefore hot spots of conflict and competition, and magma dragons are fiercely territorial by necessity. Their scales radiate heat and wisps of smoke.

      <DefaultText>Contrary to popular belief, sea dragons don't spend their entire lives underwater. Before reaching their full maturity, sea dragons will roost in seaside caves or rocky outcroppings with access to their native waters. From these private and easily-defended structures, dragons can feed or rest with minimal concern for their safety. These accomplished swimmers dive under the waves to hunt - either picking off aquatic prey or using the water as a staging ground to ambush fishing boats (graduating only to military or mercantile vessels when their size allows for it) - but they don't tarry in the sea for long or risk attracting predators of the deep. As they grow older and more confident, sea dragons will test their limitations by spending more of their time underwater, carving out a broad territory by challenging the most intimidating leviathans they encounter and arranging their bones to decorate the sea floor. It is not beyond the realm of possibility that elder sea dragons carve out secondary dens in the lightless depths, but such activity has never been conclusively documented.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An effigy of Skaen is a horrific creature called into being only by those most desperately oppressed who are willing to commit unspeakable acts to set themselves free.

Worshipers must choose one of their number to serve as the effigy, shaving this person's hair and removing all signs and symbols of gender or identity. The person is then scourged bloody over every inch of their body, their ears and nose cut off, their eyes gouged out and replaced with shiny black stones. Finally, they are made to drink the "privileged blood" of a person of wealth or high birth. This blood must be fresh, and the effigy must consume every drop.

If the offering is accepted by the god - which is not guaranteed - Skaen will manifest in the effigy and become an utterly unstoppable and pitiless vessel of the god's power, immune to pain and imbued with a monstrous strength. As soon as the target oppressors are slain - usually in a gruesome manner - the effigy falls dead.

True appearances of the effigy are vanishingly rare. In the most recent recorded case, about a century before the present day, an effigy reportedly led a backwoods peasant rebellion during which an entire noble family was captured, flayed alive, and nailed to the roof of their estate to be devoured by birds and flies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Tigers are solitary, silent hunters who stalk the fauna of their native lands, the Deadfire Archipelago. The largest of Eora's feline species, tigers have long, muscular frames and powerful forelimbs. Their preferred mode of attack is to leap upon prey from behind, knock it to the ground, and snap its neck with their jaws. The few kith who have lived to recount their tale of a tiger's attack report that were not even aware they were being hunted.

As increasingly larger populations of kith have settled in Deadfire, attacks by tigers have grown more frequent and widespread. Though they prefer deer, antelope, and other similar creatures, tigers will hunt kith when their habitat is threatened and their favored prey is subsequently unavailable. Some tigers who attack kith develop a preference for their flesh and become the terror of entire villages.

Tigers are the subject of many local myths and legends, one of which credits them with the ability to turn into mist to better stalk their prey.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Significantly larger than their more diminutive brethren, the Deadfire's giant bats have traded in a docile herbivorous diet for a strictly carnivorous one. They are aggressive and clever, making them a scourge of local populations - while they rarely attack towns and villages, they won't hesitate to descend upon the lone traveler outside of settled areas. In recent years, there have been scattered reports by colonial settlers of giant bats unlatching windows and, in one bizarre incident, an armory door.

Giant bats are, as their name implies, quite large. Though their wingspans are remarkable - nearly six feet from thumb to thumb - the weight of their long, muscular bodies curtails their ability to fly between islands. Consequently, giant bats are highly specialized to their home island environments, resulting in a truly remarkable variety of bat types.

The way giant bats hunt is somewhat unusual. They do not echolocate but instead crash into their intended prey, hoping to knock the prey to the ground where it can be more easily subdued. Compounding their threat, giant bats are also a natural disease reservoir, capable of transmitting several fatal illnesses - like jungle rot and the pox - through their saliva. Due to their long association with giants bats, the Huana are largely immune to this manner of disease transmission. Colonists, unfortunately, are not.</DefaultText>

He is usually depicted as a small, bald man covered in lash scars whose ears and nose have been cut off. He appears outwardly submissive, with downcast eyes.

He is known to manifest in a horrific incarnation known as the Effigy to followers desperate enough to perform certain unspeakable rites. In Dyrwood, Skaen's faithful often double as torturers and executioners, delighting in the fall of high-status prisoners.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Od Nua was a powerful Engwithan tyrant. He went mad after the death of his son, Maros, because he knew there were no gods to ensure he would be properly reincarnated. He dedicated his life to carving a massive statue of his son out of living adra with the intention of drawing Maros' soul out of the Beyond by force.

Od Nua was defeated through the efforts of other Engwithan tyrants, who buried him with his work. In later centuries, colonists built a castle over the ruins and named it Caed Nua. Like the ruins themselves, Caed Nua was considered cursed.</DefaultText>

Most of them are barbarians, transmutation wizards, and chanters who specialize in overcoming larger forces. They are most often sent with the vanguard to soften new territories for conquest or to quell rebellion in troublesome provinces. As barbarians and wizards, they use their abilities to transform the battlefield to their advantage and then overwhelm their opponents. The wizards open great rifts in the earth to destroy entrenched defenses, turn the air to poison to divide and route enemy units, and boil rivers to block retreats. Meanwhile, barbarians wear down enemy forces, and lore college chanters strengthen allies and intimidate foes with songs of the unit's valor. In their tactical prowess, their mastery of warfighting techniques, and their tactical foresight, they exemplify many of Rauatai's key virtues.</DefaultText>

The nation of Aedyr is at its heart and houses the majority of its human and elven populace. Aedyr was once a powerful colonial force, but the loss of Readceras and the Dyrwood reduced its stature.

Dominantly populated by island aumaua who make up the tribes of the Huana, the chain of hundreds of islands spans thousands of miles. The Deadfire contains myriad climates and biomes that are home to a bewildering array of creatures. The last century has brought ambitious colonial traders, explorers, and pirates to the Deadfire, but travel east of the archipelago is blocked by the destructive storms of Ondra's Mortar.

Legends among the Huana speak of an ancient cataclysm that devastated their people thousands of years ago. Details of this event have been lost to time, but Huana storytellers claim that it destroyed everything they had built, sinking even the greatest of their cities beneath the waves.</DefaultText>

Originally founded as an agricultural colony of Aedyr, Readceras struggled to provide for both itself as well as its imperial masters. During a time of great turmoil in the country, the god Eothas appeared to the people in the form of a farmer named Waidwen. Proclaimed a living saint by the deeply religious populace, Waidwen led the country into a war against their southern neighbors in the Dyrwood. The so-called Saint's War was a brutal conflict that ended with the destruction of Saint Waidwen via a unique device known as the Godhammer Bomb. Since the end of the Saint's War, Readceras has continued to struggle. In recent years, many farmers have left the country for the Deadfire Archipelago, working as farmers and laborers on Vailian and Rauataian colonies.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It is unclear how long ago the pale elves (Glamfellen) came to the southern polar regions of the world, but they have lived there for at least 12,000 years based on their continuous contact with aumaua traders. They are one of the most stationary ethnic groups in the known world, migrating within the polar region but seldom venturing far north. They are rare in northern lands and most people consider them exotic - if they have seen one at all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Mountain dwarves (Aptapo) originated on the continent of Aedyr in the Old Empires, but had disappeared from those lands long before humans and elves arrived there. They have spread rapidly throughout the world over the millennia due to their instinctive drive to explore and migrate. While mountain dwarves do form settlements and even small nations, they are more often found within other cultures, most commonly Old Vailia, the Vailian Republics, and the Dyrwood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Most boreal dwarves (Enutanik) live in the remote southern island of Naasitaq, where they share the rocky tundra and snow-covered forests with migratory pale elves and the coast-hugging ships of aumaua. Like their northern cousins, Enutanik share an instinctive love of exploration. Boreal dwarves are most commonly encountered in The White that Wends or the southern reaches of the Deadfire Archipelago and are only rarely seen in other lands.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Death godlike are the most distrusted of their kind. Strange growths cover their eyes - or, in some cases, entire face - giving them a sinister appearance. The growths are transparent for the godlike but opaque from the outside, hiding their features. &lt;xg&gt;Death&lt;/xg&gt; godlike are commonly killed at birth because many cultures consider them to be harbingers of doom.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bodies of fire godlike often resemble hot metal, burnt wood, or stone, with harmless flames that erupt from the cracks in their skin. Fire godlike are objects of both reverence and fear in the Deadfire Archipelago. Many locals believe they have the power to awaken volcanoes - or that killing one will cause a volcano to awaken. In the Dyrwood, fire godlike are often seen as a sign of the blessing of Magran, goddess of war and fire.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Nature godlike appear to be a fusion of human and animal features, often covered by plants, moss, or fungi. This has led to the common stigma that they are diseased, and many are killed at birth because of it. Many druidic orders have a keen interest in nature godlike because of their general curiosity as to how souls occupy animals, plants, and stones. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Moon godlike are the most tolerated of the godlike. While their skin tone and a large moon-like growth on their foreheads may be strange to some, their appearances are generally considered more palatable by the other kith. Sailors have many beliefs about moon godlike and their propensity to bring luck, though there is little agreement as to what kind of luck they tend to bring.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Hearth orlans are found in many forested areas of the Eastern Reach (where they originated) and occasionally as slaves both there and in the Old Empires. Distinguished from wild orlans by their less hirsute faces and bodies, hearth orlans generally receive a less negative reception from other kith. While they can be found in the Deadfire, they are seldom seen in significant numbers.</DefaultText>

While they have only been significantly separated from hearth orlans for a thousand years, they are easily distinguished by their hairy faces and bodies. Wild orlans are common in the deep reaches of Eir Glanfath and rarely encountered elsewhere due to widespread enslavement and prejudice against them.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Viewed by many in the Old Empires and Eastern Reach as a warlike race, the coastal aumaua are dominantly from the northern nation of Rauatai. Though they originated in the Deadfire Archipelago thousands of years ago, time and distance have divorced them from their distant Huana kin. Coastal aumaua are less intimately connected to the sea than island aumaua and are distinguished by their cool skin tones.</DefaultText>

While physiologically similar to their coastal cousins, the coloration of island aumaua is starkly different - warm tones, contrasting the coastal's cool blues and green. While not all island aumaua are connected to the native Huana culture of the Deadfire, it is rare to find them in the Eastern Reach, much less the Old Empires.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Inspirations, like Afflictions, are groups of effects that are applied to characters. Unlike Afflictions, Inspirations provide positive benefits to the character they are applied to.

Each Inspiration is categorized by an Attribute, such as Might or Dexterity. Inspirations counter and grant immunity to any and all Afflictions of the corresponding Attribute. E.g. the Smart Inspiration cancels and removes the Confused, Charmed, and Dominated Afflictions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>While many wizards learn their magic from private teachers or even universities, it is far superior to earn an apprenticeship with an established wizard or archmage. Relationships between apprentices and their mistresses or masters are commonly tough and occasionally abusive. This is due both to the eccentricities of powerful wizards as well as their desire to discourage timid students from seeking them out.</DefaultText>

Resource: Discipline

Fighters form the front line of disciplined armies across the Eastern Reach. Though they are most commonly found in cultures with an organized martial structure, fighters can also be encountered as wandering mercenaries, bodyguards, and other types of sell-swords. The common element that unifies fighters is their heavy focus on endurance and melee defense. </DefaultText>

Rogues are vicious killers, feared for the brutality of their attacks. They can be found as often in dark back alleys as the heart of battlefield skirmishes. Though unpredictable and undisciplined, rogues are commonly used as &lt;xg&gt;shock&lt;/xg&gt; troops or as part of a surprise assault, their withering attacks breaking enemy ranks and &lt;xg&gt;morale&lt;/xg&gt;. Rogues tend to congregate in larger numbers in cities where they can be steadily employed as mercenaries or hired muscle.</DefaultText>

Priests are devotees of Eora's deities and practitioners of religious magic. While all priests dedicate themselves to specific gods, priests' power is actually derived from their personal beliefs. In contrast to most paladins, priests tend to focus on philosophy, teaching, and the relationship of religious organizations with common folk. The reception of priests in any given part of the world depends largely on how their god is revered - or reviled - by the people who live there. </DefaultText>

Wizards are a highly organized group, often forming academies or guilds devoted to research and development in magical studies, and tend to favor environments where inquiry, experimentation, debate, and the dissemination of knowledge are encouraged. Many accomplished wizards eventually become known for their eccentricity, their egos, and their unquenchable interest in all things arcane and occult.</DefaultText>

Though city-dwelling people often use the term "barbarian" with a dose of disrespect, these rural warriors are respected by their communities for their ferocity and fearsome presence on the battlefield. Barbarians have a special, almost religious role in some cultures, but in many places, the undisciplined, fearless style of the barbarian is simply how warriors conduct themselves. </DefaultText>

Animists at heart, druids tap into the spiritual power that flows through the simple living things of Eora: plants, animals, and sometimes even living stone. While not necessarily religious, druids do have a reverence for the natural world and a keen interest in understanding its mysteries. In most cultures, druids are understood as a sort of primal magician, but among the Glanfathans, Naasitaqi, and many rural cultures, they may have high positions of influence and authority.</DefaultText>

Paladins are martial zealots, devoted to a god, a ruler, or even a way of life. They can be found in any culture where a fanatical group of like-minded individuals have formed a warrior society dedicated to advancing their cause. Among those aligned to their worldview, paladins are viewed with respect and admiration, if a bit of fear. Many paladins hold leadership positions in armies and mercenary companies, but in the heat of battle their fanaticism often overrules the chain of command - and common sense. </DefaultText>

Monks belong to a variety of fighting orders that have sprung up in Ixamitl and the Eastern Reach over the past few centuries. While many monastic orders can trace their teachings to the Enduring Founder, Tletac, individual organizations vary greatly in their focus, morality, and ethics. Common folk respect the incredible discipline of monks but see them as an odd, unpredictable bunch who may not be entirely sane. Even mercenaries and other adventurers aren't sure what to make of them. </DefaultText>

Resource: Focus

A recent discovery in the Eastern Reach, ciphers were once called "brîshalgwin" ("mind hunters") by the Glanfathans. Ciphers have the ability to directly contact and manipulate another person's soul and psyche, using an ally's or enemy's essence as the focus for their magic. Though most ciphers are still found in the Eastern Reach, practitioners of the techniques have spread throughout the known world. They are gaining acceptance over time, but are generally distrusted, especially by the uneducated.</DefaultText>

Resource: Phrases

In every culture across Eora, there are chanters. Many historians consider chanters to be the most ancient workers of magic, their hallowed phrases stirring the collective memory of wayward souls around them, compelling them to generate magical effects in a kind of "reenactment." In some societies, chanters form organized groups of storytellers and researchers, but in most parts of the world they are just a time-honored part of local folk traditions. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Bears are widely distributed across the Deadfire Archipelago. They favor dens dug into hillsides where their preferred foods - murkberries, yalōa nuts, and ants - are plentiful. Slightly smaller than their Eastern Reach cousins, Deadfire bears are nonetheless vicious opponents when goaded to violence.

In the early years of Deadfire colonization, colonists were occasionally killed in bear attacks. The Tikawara bear incident is particularly infamous. Seven colonists died in the first attack, then three more the following night when the bear returned during a funeral vigil.

On occasion, Deadfire bears have been known to fall prey to tigers, adult females and their cubs being especially vulnerable. This is attributed in part to their inability to climb trees, unlike their counterparts across the sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Gaun is an aspect of Eothas associated with death and harvests. His implements are symbolically important: the sickle reaps what is sowed in life, and the lantern guides the deceased down their intended paths of death and rebirth. It is generally believed that Gaun, instead of Berath's avatars, visits those who embrace death with acceptance and understanding. His most fervent devotees are known as "Harvesters of Gaun."

Gaun is an answerer of wrongs and imbalances. This has contributed no small part to Dyrwood's enthusiasm for vigilante justice. Popular regard for Gaun is polarizing: he is appreciated, feared, and characterized by a grim sense of finality. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Lagufaeth are territorial, four-armed amphibians. Though their thick skin protects them from the cold climate of the White March, their native land, they tend to favor hot springs and consequently feel right at home in the sultry waters of the Deadfire Archipelago. Lagufaeth are communal wilder with rudimentary weapons but a natural aptitude for magic. They are especially dangerous in the mountains, where storms and snowfall may hide their presence from travelers until it's too late. They can remain under ice for extended periods of time and have been known to surprise unwary fishermen.

A lagufaeth redfin is a dominant, mature lagufaeth. They may be male or female. A lagufaeth that transitions into a redfin develops a reddish-brown tint to its skin and a bony crest atop its head. They are rarely the oldest member of a group, but they are the most aggressive, and they are typically responsible for defending a nest or group. When a lagufaeth redfin loses status, its crest falls off and its skin returns to a shade of blue, green, or purple.</DefaultText>
