      <DefaultText>"Ado, stranger! Or is it captain? You have the carriage of a captain. A noble bearing, all around."

      <DefaultText>"I did no one any harm! I am at the Kraken's Eye so often Thorel should pay &lt;i&gt;me&lt;/i&gt;. I sample every bottle for quality.

      <DefaultText>"Do I know ships, he asks. I know every vessel on these waters. Every one. From the galleon to the... to the... every one of them, sir.

"You have enemies? These fists will drive them into the waiting arms of the sea goddess."

He clenches his fists, raising them above his head for emphasis.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"A matter of coin. Four hundred beautiful coins. 

"...That, or the key, yes? The door is the thing." 

Riggere leans in to wrap his fingers around the bars of his cell, rattling them to no effect. He sets his forehead to the bars, sighing.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"You think me idle, to ask this of you and do nothing? I have scratched, sir, a little mortar from beneath the bars at the window at every chance.

"The, ah, stonework, it is very strong. I can do nothing by hand. With tools, perhaps. With... explosives, for certain."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"The commander, she guards the key like a jealous wife. It would take steady hands to slip it from her pocket.

"That is, if you have need of keys at all." He turns a finger in small circles by the lock, and winks clumsily at you.</DefaultText>
