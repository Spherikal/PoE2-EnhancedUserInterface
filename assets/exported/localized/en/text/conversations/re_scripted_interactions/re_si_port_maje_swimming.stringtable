      <DefaultText>As you travel northwest, you discover a broad channel separating you from the flat expanse of a sandy islet.

A wooden bridge spans the waterway, easily wide enough to accommodate a cart and horse.</DefaultText>

      <ID>2</ID>
      <DefaultText>A crowd throngs the bridge, an eclectic menagerie of clean-coated Vailians, aumaua in bright and colorful robes, and even the odd orlan.

Down the hill, by the water's edge, a small cluster of aumaua have gathered.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The bridge seems relatively new, little worn for something on the coast. The flat slats are utterly without ostentation, the structure crafted solely for functionality. 

The quiet murmur of conversation rises as you approach, entirely overwhelming the susurrus of the sea.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>From the shore, you see that the channel's current seems significantly stronger than it had from afar, perhaps fed by the recent storms. 

The Huana gathered here, garbed in thin robes and little else, watch as you approach. One steps forward, her own gown in far brighter colors than those around her.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She smiles warmly. "Ngati's blessings on you, friend. You are of the Huana, unless I mistake you. Have you come to challenge the Osa's currents?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>She raises an eyebrow. "You look an islander born and bred, but you're no Huana." She nods towards the bridge. "If you come to watch, the better viewing's from the bridge."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>An orlan, his deep brown fur a close match to the boards beneath your feet, approaches you and doffs a wide-brimmed hat as he bows. "Greetings, stranger. Come to eye the race?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Several of the gathered Huana chuckle. The woman merely smiles, bowing her head slightly. 

"Challenging Osa, it is always done by aumaua to prove strength and stamina in the water. I stay afraid it may be too much for another kith."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The arc of her hand describes first the swimmers, then the waters, then the islet on the other side. "They challenge the Osa Channel. The rains fell, and the waters run swift. They must swim swifter yet. For each who finishes, there is honor. For the one who wins, there is more."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>You return to the group by the water. The aumaua have stripped to their waists and smear thick, white paste across their chests, faces, and arms.

The master of ceremonies nods to you.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The orlan grins. "Ain't from around here, are you?" His Readceran accent suggests that he isn't either. 

"It's a local tradition. A swim race up the Osa Channel after a big storm, when the current's at its strongest. Winner gets a..." He scratches the back of his head. "...some kind of gewgaw or somesuch. Bragging rights, too."</DefaultText>

      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>You join the orlan by the rail and watch as the aumaua on the shore disrobe. They crouch on stones along the water as the master of ceremonies lifts a hand above her head.

When she drops it, they flash into the water like cannonballs. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"It's ten shells to bet. That's roughly fifty pands, and you bet I'll happily take that in copper or silver." He winks.

"Odds are three to one on that big bald woman. The wiry blond pays out five to one. If you bet on the ropey kid and you win, you net ten times what you put in."</DefaultText>
