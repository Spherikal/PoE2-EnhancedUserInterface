      <DefaultText>On the horizon, a ship comes into view. Its sails furled, the ship lists upon the water. 

"Plague ship!" [Specified 0] cries out from the fore, finger jabbing skyward, indicating a green flag billowing lazily in the breeze on the ship's main mast.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crew guides your ship next to the plague vessel. The deckhands and captain appear shocked and apprehensive.

"Hylea's mercy!" the captain blurts out, his voice raspy, "I didn't think anyone would come to our aid."

The deckhands stand tall, but their unsteady posture betrays the sickness that seems to have affected them all.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The captain looks on bitterly as your crew hauls the remainder of their meager supplies aboard your ship.

"Ondra take you." He tries to summon up a glob of spittle but is too parched to do so.

Pulling away from the plague ship, you see the captain slump and collapse to the ground in despair. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As your main sail goes up and you head into open water, [Specified 2] lets out a raspy cough and looks around, nervously.

The rest of the crew grits their teeth and mutters curses. It appears the sickness has spread to your ship.</DefaultText>

"A wise decision, captain."

      <DefaultText>A volley of fire erupts from [Player Ship], tearing across the hull of the plague ship.

It lists to one side, taking on water, and you see members of its crew leaping into the water. Their screams carry.

"What a waste." [Specified 2] frowns. "Should we see if there's salvage? The plague's sunk now, isn't it?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As your crew guides your ship next to the afflicted craft, the captain stumbles over. A spear of bright, white bone obtrudes from the side of her neck. "Gods..." She rasps. "You here to help?"

You look down and see that the joints of her wrists and ankles are wreathed with similar eruptions, the skin around her wounds red and weeping.</DefaultText>
