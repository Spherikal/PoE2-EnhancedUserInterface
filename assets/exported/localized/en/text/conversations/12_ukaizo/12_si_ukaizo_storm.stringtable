      <DefaultText>You sail in the direction of the closest pillar, fighting the sea to keep a wide berth from the ravaging storm. Waves crash against the glowing surface of the adra directly ahead.

The animancers are too busy to concern themselves with choppy waters. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Deep in concentration, the watershapers at the prow of your ship mirror a complex series of stances. Prayers to Ngati begin as whispers and rise into songs bellowed in a unified voice, matching the intensity of the storm. 

The sea responds with hesitation, sending up the occasional splash of water in protest. You begin to wonder if your allies are equipped to stand against the relentless fury of Ondra's Mortar. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Heading into the mouth of the storm, you hear the sound of tearing canvas as the wind batters your sails. An unfavorable omen to the start of a hard voyage. 

You press on in spite of all misgivings, intent on making it to the bitter end.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The storms of Ondra's Mortar encompass the visible horizon. Hurricane winds roar like an imprisoned beast, blowing with enough force to warp the very seas.

Past the curtain of rain and above the swell of waves, you can just barely perceive the outline of colossal adra pillars.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Slowly but surely, the propeller spools to life and carries you forward, beneath the storms. 

You navigate around the trunks of massive adra pillars rising from the sea floor, but the work of crossing Ondra's Mortar is accomplished with ease. Finally you spot the shape of a bulky landmass ahead. It's Ukaizo.

You let out a sigh of relief.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Wave after wave rises and swells into an assumed shape - first a wall, and then an arch, forming a perfect curve that projects deeper into the storm. 

One of the watershapers sends up a call. The others make a finishing gesture in a single fluid motion - clapping their hands and extending their palms, solidifying their work.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Though you cannot shake the feeling of sorrow and wrongness which pervades your journey, you successfully cross to the far side of Ondra's Mortar and breathe a sigh of relief.

An island towers over the distant horizon. Ukaizo.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Looming in the water directly ahead stands a pillar of adra. It reaches up from the sea floor to pierce the sky like a god-sized finger aimed in accusation.</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>You can't steer fast enough to navigate around the pillar, and your ship suffers a glancing blow. A tremor and ear-splitting crunch tell of severe damage, and you wince at the ship's diminishing odds of surviving this voyage.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Your crew masters their fear and holds fast to their posts. Against all odds, the ship crests the wave successfully.

      <DefaultText>As your ship begins to crest the wave, some of the crew lose their nerve and abandon their posts. 

The wall of water overtakes you, hammering at the hull and sweeping away many of those who fled their positions.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>What begins as an irregularity in the water current broadens as the sea churns open a maelstrom. Your ship balances on the brink of being swept down. The tide redoubles its pull, intent on drawing you closer to the inescapable, hungry maw.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The wave crashes down like a fist, reducing the hull of your ship to splintered wreckage. What remains of the once-proud vessel promptly disappears beneath the waves. 

Before you go under, you catch a fleeting glimpse of a distant shape on the horizon, but a glimpse is all you get.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Two things happen in quick succession - the sound of splitting wood fills your ears, and the ship starts to drift at a lethargic pace. 

Without needing to confirm it, you know that you're taking on water. </DefaultText>

      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>Your ship rides the sheer slope of the wave and crashes back down, staying upright all the while. 

It doesn't immediately register that you have survived. While the rain continues to indignantly pelt you with water, the seas ahead look calmer than those you left behind. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Ornate spires reach up from the island, hinting at the city within. Not all of Ukaizo has weathered the millennia with equal grace. Other structures jut and lean out of the surrounding shallows, making the waters around the island impassible by ship. 

You resolve to take a skiff the rest of the way.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Shouting orders over the wind, the team coordinates the pulling of levers and spinning of wheels to activate their machine. Many of them plug their ears or mutter prayers to their gods. Others stand enraptured, gazing toward the approaching adra with an air of accomplishment. 

Then the final lever is engaged.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>As you scramble to brace for impact, one of the animancers breaks away to retrieve a copper device that fell to the deck. She snaps it back into its setting on the machine and wipes a spray of water off her brow, grinning and flashing a hopeful signal.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The machine spools to life at once, and the adra responds in kind. 

Reality grows hazy around the point of your prow, forming a rift that swallows the tip of your vessel with no time to spare. The breach expands to accommodate the rest of your ship, allowing you to sail through without resistance.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Air hisses as the ballast tanks fill with water. Groans of pressure emanate from somewhere in the hull, but your submersible gradually dips beneath the waves. You close your eyes and place your trust in Rauataian engineering.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>Even though your ship is without a crew, that doesn't make you any less of a captain. 

You move from station to station with purpose, seeing after the rigging and the sails, heedless of the water that carries up over the deck and threatens to sweep you out to sea. This wave is one more in a long succession of annoyances. </DefaultText>
