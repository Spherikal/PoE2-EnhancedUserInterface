      <DefaultText>A knock at your cabin door interrupts your reading. 

[Specified 1] stands outside, looking like someone who's just lost a bet. "Captain, you'd best come topside. There's a ship on the horizon. Looks derelict."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 0] chants an Ondrite dirge while the cannoneers ready the guns. As their song rises in volume, [Player Ship] fires a volley that hits the derelict right at the waterline.

After the ship has vanished into the depths, the crew return to their duties with quiet conviviality.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>It takes some time, but you manage to clear the blockage and open up the hold. The stench of rotting meat - and a black cloud of flies - pours out.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The ship in question lists upon the waves, its sails pulled in. Topping the mast is a green flag - the symbol of a ship carrying disease. 

You see no movement on its deck.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 1] leads you up to the forecastle, where a small gaggle of hands have gathered. 

Pawing a holy symbol, [Specified 0] points towards port. "It's a bad omen, captain. We should give them over to the Lady of Lament or there'll be trouble, mark my words."

[Specified 2] chuckles. "We don't even know if they're dead, much less what fills their holds, and you want to sink them?"</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"No one has signaled. Anyone on that ship is likely beyond help." [Specified 3] frowns.

"That ship is a hazard, captain, and not just to any who come cross it. Not to tell you your business, but I'd advise sinking it before someone gets it in their head to board it."</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Very well, captain," [Specified 1] says grimly before running to prepare the skiff.

You row out to the ship and lash the skiff in place, hearing nothing save the creaking of wood and the gentle lapping of the sea.

You climb aboard, and the first thing to greet you on the middeck are a pair of corpses dressed in simple breastplates. What little flesh they retain has shriveled tight against their bones, and the sun has bleached the exposed portions of their skulls.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The crew secures the skiff when you return but keep their distance from you. Some have tied rags about their faces.

      <ID>21</ID>
      <DefaultText>You pull out your spyglass and examine the derelict. Nothing moves abovedeck, and you spot a corpse sprawled out on the forecastle. A few more seconds' examination reveals another further aft. 

Beneath the plague signal, you see a flag depicting a lit candle in an open doorway.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>[Specified 2] shrugs and sighs, but [Specified 1] nods approvingly.

"A wise decision, captain."

The crew steers clear of the plague ship and sails on until it disappears on the receding horizon.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After a few moments of concentration, you unleash a wave of destructive power that tears the hatch apart. A cloud of flies bellow forth, shrouding the deck momentarily in black.
