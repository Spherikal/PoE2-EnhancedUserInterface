      <DefaultText>An older Mataru man stands ringed by younger Huana - apprentices or pupils, it seems. His robes shimmer with quartz beading, and his perfume announces his presence from across the room.

Yet beneath his finery, he looks like a fighter gone to seed. Disused muscles flop from his arms, and flab pads him like so many layers of silk.

He looks up and notices you.</DefaultText>
