      <DefaultText>This copper device once conducted a tidal wave of soul energy through the body of a Helfire ironclad, and seems to recall its purpose even in "death." When harnessed, the core galvanizes the wielder's soul and heightens its potency for a time. This process of refinement and invigoration must seem ordinary under a construct's frame, but when applied to a kith body the results are less predictable. Once the flow of essence runs dry, the core lets loose with a dramatic display of heat dispersal, burning off the excess energy in a wide radius. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The pages of this grimoire resemble a collection of abused palimpsests - scrawled with so many layers of overlapping writing that the result is barely legible. Closer scrutiny reveals how the intersection of arcane runes forms a coherent pattern, unlocking a deeper layer of meaning woven among the text. Wizards hoping to produce a coherent spell from these pages are in for a surprise as their arcane intentions knit together with unpredictable results. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This traveler's guide is circulated for the benefit of newcomers to the Deadfire Archipelago. One passage stands out:

"Sigilmaster Auranic is ON THE LOOSE. She was sentenced for planting DEADLY sigils in populated areas, and affected her escape with nothing more than a stone game piece and an inkwell. 

Trust in the authorities and make NO ATTEMPT to apprehend her. She will have flanked herself in sigils powerful enough to EXPLODE unwary visitors on the spot.

The Deadfire Visitor's Preservation Society takes no responsibility for harm inflicted by knowing ignorance of the risks, and every effort has been made to keep travelers AWAY from the following coordinates: 4째 50' S 67째 31' E." 

A map of Auranic's position is marked off with a wax seal in the shape of a skull. It points toward an underwater cave far to the northeast. </DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>This traveler's guide is circulated for the benefit of newcomers to the Deadfire Archipelago. One passage stands out:

"Animancers visiting from afar- do NOT seek out Dorudugan, the iron TYRANT, for academic research. DEATH will surely follow.

Whoever created this FIRE-SPITTING BEHEMOTH is responsible for the CALAMITOUS INFERNO it has wrought on the isles. The Society is unaware if the ironclad's creator died at its hands, but JUSTICE itself would demand that they be vaporized by the very flames they so RECKLESSLY stoked.

The Deadfire Visitor's Preservation Society takes no responsibility for harm inflicted by knowing ignorance of the risks, and every effort has been made to keep travelers AWAY from the following coordinates: 38째 37' S 31째 21' E." 

A map of the Helfire Colossus' position is marked off with a wax seal in the shape of a skull. It points toward a desert wasteland in the southwestern corner of the Deadfire Archipelago. </DefaultText>
