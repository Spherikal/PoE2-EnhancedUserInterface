      <DefaultText>"I can't believe it. Is that really you?" 

Solid meals and decent sleep have filled Wirtan's lean frame out somewhat, but the man retains a foxlike aspect around the face. He greets you with an indecisive smile, unsure of whether to be nervous or pleased.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"Would be nice to get some answers, maybe. Or... forgiveness. For getting his people killed.

      <DefaultText>"Took some getting used to, working shoulder to shoulder with Readcerans. But it's not so hard as you'd think.

"Feels like I'm on the right path. Toward a little piece of redemption, maybe."</DefaultText>

      <ID>13</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Lot more might've made it out if you hadn't left 'em for dead."

Edér's fists clench and unclench several times.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>14</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I haven't forgotten. It's why I'm here, Edér."

Wirtan's doesn't meet Edér's eyes. It takes visible effort for him to meet yours.</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>20</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Just the fella that left a bunch of Eothasians to die in their own temple, back in Gilded Vale. Folks that trusted him.

"Other than that, pretty unmemorable."

Edér takes a menacing step toward the man.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>"I... It's true. I was a &lt;i&gt;coward&lt;/i&gt;, Edér. I won't argue that. I'm trying to make things right."

Wirtan's shoulders curl inward, but he makes no move to get out of Edér's way. </DefaultText>

Wirtan smiles, and inclines his head in a bow.</DefaultText>

      <ID>29</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I never got a sign from Eothas to begin with. There was just... you.

    <Entry>
      <ID>32</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Hear that comes with the job. You being a Watcher, I mean." 

Wirtan grins sheepishly, then ducks his head.

      <ID>33</ID>
      <DefaultText>"So now I'm doing what I can. Handing out food, mostly, or delivering supplies. 

"Familiar work, I guess."</DefaultText>

    <Entry>
      <ID>34</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, it was a close thing for a while, with that... thing ruling Gilded Vale in Raedric's place. 

"I made it out with some of the other families. Came out here when the Dawnstars came through town."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>35</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Well, it was a close thing for a while. If that makes you feel better. 

"Didn't feel like I was doing much good back in Gilded Vale. Or anywhere. Not until I caught word about the Dawnstars."</DefaultText>

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>37</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I spent years like that. Just me and the terrible thing I'd done. It sat in my gut for years, tearing me up."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>38</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Things got rough for us back in Gilded Vale. Even after the Hollowborn curse ended.

"Didn't feel like I was doing much good there. Or anywhere. Not until I caught word about the Dawnstars."</DefaultText>
      <FemaleText />
    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>39</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I kept to my word. I started trying to help around town, like you told me. When the Hollowborn curse ended, it was like... You can't imagine what that meant to everyone.

"We had some good years."

      <ID>41</ID>
      <DefaultText>"I've been helping out here, with the Dawnstars. Handing out food, mostly, or delivering supplies.

    </Entry>
    <Entry>
      <ID>43</ID>
      <DefaultText>"Peace of mind, or something close. That's good enough for me."

Wirtan flashes you a final, crooked smile, than inclines his head in a bow.</DefaultText>
