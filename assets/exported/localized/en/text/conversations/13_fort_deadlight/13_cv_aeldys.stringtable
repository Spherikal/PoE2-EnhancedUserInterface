      <DefaultText>"You must be Captain [Player Name]. Glad you could make it, lovesome."

      <DefaultText>"Ah, Captain [Player Name]. Beholding you never ceases to be a wonder.

"I only wish we met under more... pleasurable circumstances."

She rubs her thumb over her bottom lip, blue and black eyes hooded with desire - for bloodshed. For other things.</DefaultText>
